A culinary nut is a dry, edible fruit or seed that usually, but not always, has a high fat content. Nuts are used in a wide variety of edible roles, including in baking, as snacks (either roasted or raw), and as flavoring. In addition to botanical nuts, fruits and seeds that have a similar appearance and culinary role are considered to be culinary nuts.[1] Culinary nuts are divided into fruits or seeds in one of four categories:
    • True, or botanical nuts: dry, hard-shelled, uncompartmented fruit that do not split on maturity to release seeds;[2][3]
    • Drupes: seed contained within a pit (stone or pyrene) that itself is surrounded by a fleshy fruit (e.g. almonds);[4]
    • Gymnosperm seeds: naked seeds, with no enclosure (e.g. pine nuts);
    • Angiosperm: seeds surrounded by an enclosure, such as a pod or a fruit (e.g. peanuts).
Nuts have a rich history as food. For many indigenous peoples of the Americas, a wide variety of nuts, including acorns, American beech, and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years.[5] Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries.[6] Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized by the work of George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.[7]
True nuts[edit]

A kola nut
The following are both culinary and botanical nuts.
    • Acorn (Quercus, Lithocarpus and Cyclobalanopsis spp.), used from ancient times among indigenous peoples of the Americas as a staple food, in particular for making bread and porridge.[8]
    • Afghan hazelnut (Hircum nuces), a delicacy among the native peoples of Afghanistan and Pakistan.[9]
    • Beech (Fagus spp.)
        ? American beech (Fagus grandifolia), used by indigenous peoples of the Americas as food. Several tribes sought stores of beech nuts gathered by chipmunks and deer mice, thus obtaining nuts that were already sorted and shelled.[10]
        ? European beech (Fagus sylvatica), although edible, have never been popular as a source of food. They have been used as animal feed and to extract a popular edible oil.[11]
    • Breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), used by the ancient Maya peoples as animal fodder, and as an alternative food when yield of other crops was insufficient.[12]
    • Candlenut (Aleurites moluccana), used in many South East Asian cuisines.[13]
    • Chestnuts (Castanea spp.)
        ? Chinese chestnuts (Castanea mollissima), have been eaten in China since ancient times.[14]
        ? Sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa), unlike most nuts are high in starch and sugar. Extensively grown in Europe and the Himalayas.[15]
    • Hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), most commercial varieties of which descend from the European hazelnut (Corylus avellana).[16] Hazelnuts are used to make pralines, in the popular Nutella spread, in liqueurs, and in many other foods.
        ? American hazelnut (Corylus americana), appealing for breeding because of its relative hardiness.[16]
        ? Deeknut (Corylus Dikana), grows in hot, excessively dry areas.[17] An occasional garnish used in middle-eastern dishes.
        ? Eastern and western beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), native to the United States.[18]
        ? European hazelnut (Corylus avellana), source of most commercial hazelnuts.[18]
        ? Filbert (Corylus maxima), commonly used as "filler" in mixed nut combinations.[18]
        ? Several other species are edible, but not commercially cultivated to any significant extent. These include the cold-tolerant Siberian hazelnut (C. heterophylla), C. kweichowensis, which grows in the warmer parts of China, C. sieboldiana, which grows in Japan and China, and other minor Corylus species.[16]

    • Mongongo (Ricinodendron rautanenii), abundant source of protein among Bushmen in the Kalahari desert.[23] Also of interest as a source of oil for skin care.[24]
    • Palm nuts (Elaeis guineensis), important famine food among the Himba people in Africa.[25]
    • Karuka (Pandanus spp.), native to Papua New Guinea. Both the planted and wild species are eaten raw, roasted or boiled, providing food security when other foods are less available.[26]
        ? Planted karuka (Pandanus julianettii), cultivated species, planted by roughly half the rural population of Papua New Guinea.[27]
        ? Wild karuka (Pandanus brosimos), important food source in villages at higher altitudes in New Guinea.[27]
    • Red bopple nut (Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia), native to the east coast of Australia.[28] Low in fat, high in calcium and potassium. Eaten as bush food. Considered similar, but inferior to the macadamia.
    • Yellow walnut (Beilschmiedia bancroftii), native to Australia where it served as a staple food among Indigenous Australians.[29]

The nut must be roasted (or steamed) to remove the caustic shell oil before being consumed.[40]
    • Chilean hazel (Gevuina avellana), from an evergreen native to South America, similar in appearance and taste to the hazelnut.[41]
    • Coconut (Cocos nucifera), used worldwide as a food. The fleshy part of the seed is edible, and used either desiccated or fresh as an ingredient in many foods. The pressed oil from the coconut is used in cooking as well.[42]
