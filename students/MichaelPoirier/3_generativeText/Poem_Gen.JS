var DescriptionArray = ["I traveled down a road, and as I walked down the road I also went back in time, until I was in America during the Vietnam war. In this world America was connected to Britian, which was connected to china. I happened to be walking on a hill, and I saw a swamp that would later  become a lake. The land was covered in snow. The hill sloped down into a steep valley, and  on the other side was a parallel hill. The valley was the border of Britain and China. On the  opposing hill, Chinese machine gun men, and artillery were trying to shoot me. I skied down  the side of the hill, and dodged all of the bullets. After skiing to the forest area, the snow stopped. The trees there looked like there were in Fall and I was still in Britain. While jogging though  the neighborhood, I saw a cluster of Vietnam forces exchanging fire with British soldiers in  the woods, next to the neighborhood. Farmers on the porch of their houses grabbed guns, and  chairs and watched the skirmish on standby; waiting to join in if they needed to. I ran by and  noted that the skirmish happened at a creek. Then I walked forward in time, and ended up in  the 1980s.",
"The dream starts with me being logged into a VR game. It was raining hard. I was on the side of a road and it was a dirt one. I walked down the road and it led to a mountain, and there was a cave  opening with a light inside, full of laughter,and life. Outside this cave, was a bill board that was very  faded and torn. It showed a figure on it that I couldn’t see. The figure had its arms opened  and had text in its open arms. The bill board was very low, I could climb onto it if I wanted to. It was longer than it was tall. I was taller than than the board itself. Besides this was a sea saw, and  underneath that was a giant book, 8 by 8 feet. It was torn, and the binding were off. It depicted the new revelations apocalypse, in a cartoon manner, and it was slightly inaccurate and stylized. Next  to this against the mountains side, was an oil painting, depicting a blasphemous diagram of  the devil and jesus being cousins. Going into the cave, I see a very narrow cliff path, and the mountain is hollowed out to reveal multiple cities. There are all on there own cliff islands, while a  single tall land strip leading up to them. In the pit below, lava lights up the cave. One of the cities are  green with emeralds, the other with ruby reds, and the last one with topaz golden. There were  places where the player could level up or buy equipment, buy food,stay the night, and  receive quests. I started a quest outside near the bill board. You could see the road led to a path that  went down a hill and curved steeply left. It was still pouring. I made camp right next to the  bill board. I had one power bar as food. Then a man came by. He was anglo-saxon, but tan. He  had a 5 o clock shadow. He was with two younger children who looked like him. He held a  walking stick. He came over and talked to me to see if I had any food. Later on, he stole my  power bar behind my back, and went down the road. I went after him, and after following the path  down the hill, I ended up at a tunnel with ribbon windows lining it. It crossed over a river, and the river  was violent. The tunnel was a modern, white polished surface. It was like an underwater  marine tunnel. I caught up to him, but he refused to give the power bar back. He gave me a kit kat XL  bar instead. He then left with the kids. Then when I inspected the bar, it had maggots inside it.  I ran after him again, then I met up with him at a place near the shore. I could see a massive  light house in the distance connected to a sloped modern deconstructionism building. I  said in trade for the power bar I would work for him. He said he had been traveling to raid the  light house for any provisions and items. We ventured into the light house and went down  many flights, and saw that it went deep underwater, there were no guards. When we got to the end, we  saw a  giant blue energy orb that the man wanted. When he was trying to open the valve to the chamber, I realized that if he did that he would cause the pressurization to shift greatly, due to the  release of the crystal, and the base would cave in and flood. I ran out, and he yelled at me, and then the  hatch came open, and I saw the windows crack and break open. I kept running up flights of stairs, and I heard robots starting to activate. I took a different route back to avoid the now even worse  storm, as the storm became even more viscous after that event. I had to travel through a  marsh, where I could jump on multiple mushrooms for points, and dodge swamp dragons. I eventually  made it back to my camp. The mission was complete and I got paid. I was able to buy a  Chinese supermarket dish, and it was rice with glazed chicken.",
"A war in space had broke out between Zorgs, alien monsters, and two rival arms manufactures making weapons to exterminate them. There was an arms war between the Deadnet company and the Darknet company. They made Exo gear, plasma weapons, and nuclear fusion tech. When hearing about the war I realized it could cause massive problems for earth, so I head out to my secret bunker. However, government soldiers followed me and tried to take me down. They had invaded the upper areas of the bunker, and ambushed me. As a lucid, I was able to blow them away with a hand wave, and crush many of them with a thought. I brought some friends with me as well. Going down into the deepest level of the bunker I showed my friends the cube room. It was a giant compartment, that I revealed had the ability to manipulate the fabric of reality while inside the box. Opening a ceiling door, l egos started to fall out. I told them we could make weapons without limitations with these Legos. We did, and we showed up at the war between Deadnet, Zorgs, and Darknet. Using Overpowered Items we killed them all. However, someone got carried away and caused a black hole, and it was so strong that it sucked the planet up and reset time to the stone age. I then had to freeze time and reset the dimension. Then we ended up in the bunker again, this time with no troopers. Then it turned out that my phone was infected with a virus that would cause the black hole again in 5 seconds. So then I had to freeze time again, and negate the virus. Later on I told the stories to my father."
,"The dream took place in a mountainous area. It was near a series of mountain peaks, it was all snowy. Snow was falling and grey clouds were in the air. The sunlight was sparse, as the clouds around us paled it. It was still daytime but it just looked like a stormy snowy day. On top of this mountain which was either in the Himalayas or the Yule mountains, a giant mansion complex stood. It was a getaway home owned by my parents.  My room was in their and it looked exactly like the real world room I have, only this one is onside a mansion.  The mansion complex looked Victorian aged, was reddish grey, and was 5 or more stories high. Sometimes it felt like a tower. Its roof was solid metal. It was heavily fortified for the weather and In terms of impact resistance. We held a graduation party here. People came via gondola up the mountain. People from my high school came in through the white painted halls, to arrive at the party room seeking out entertainment and lounge.  I saw someone had arrived in some sports car that was red, and that they had been able to drive up the mountain path made for the mansion. They arrived at the side of the mansion where the side entrance and the gondola was. Everything was fine. I was walking around meeting people. Eventually I hiked up a mountain hill, and I could over see the mountain. I then saw a thin red drone plane fly over me, and smash into the roof of the mansion. It was a terrorist attack, but I knew in bitterness and worldly perception that it would be hidden in some sort a cover up story to the world. However the mansion was strong enough that the drone destroyed itself on impact, and the roof was only scratched. Everyone else was unharmed and the party continued. The dream then faded to me waking up in my room after the party. I was trying to turn off my morning alarms but I saw that the alarm was coming from a fax Machine, and thus I could not figure out how to turn it off. Then the dream ended and I woke up to my morning alarm."
,"It was a normal day at the pool. I was doing my normal swim practices. The pool was a white tiled pool. It also had blue tile stripes around the edges of the pool. It had multiple layers. One pool was on the ground level. Then behind that was an elevated platform that rose 1 meter. On that elevated platform there was a second pool. There were both short course, 6 laned pools. The bottom one was vertical, and the other one was horizontal. When you walked into the entrance, you saw the bottom one as being horizontal. The ceiling was painted white, and was decently tall, 30 feet up. I did my normal swimming with my friends. I was training to be faster, and stronger. However, odd things started happening over time. My friends started ignoring me, and other swimmers gave me odd looks. Then one day I arrived at the pool to see a clone of me sitting on a bench near the entrance, talking to my friends. It saw me and tried to run down a basement stairs to the bench, but I was too quick. I appeared behind it and karate chopped its neck, causing it to die instantly. Then all the other guys, who were my friends turned to me, and then they started to mutate. They turned into 8 foot tall men that were ripped and grotesque. One turned into a blue monstrous canine with yellow glowing eyes, and a white underbelly. They prepared to attack me. I realized that they were not my friends, and that they were also clones. The dog lunged at me. I caught its neck with one hand. It tried to escape but, my hand was an iron grip. I then snapped its neck with one hand, and threw it into a wall. It crashed through the concrete wall and died."
,"It was a world under fire and assualt. Harry Potter, for whom I saw the world through his eyes, was racing to stop Voldemort and the death eaters, from reaching the Master Philosophers stone. The location was at Hogwarts where Voldemort was trying to reach the stone, which would grant him limitless power of magic in both the unknown and known. It was located on an island in the sky above hogwarts. The death eaters had enslaved and imprisoned most of the people in Hogwarts, while people in the resistance, like Ron and Hermione, were only pretending to be under control. Harry was traveling to reach Hogwarts. When he got there, he saw that the sky had split apart, and the clouds had turned blood red. A stair case made from stone had appeared and ascended to the heavens, where the Master Philosopher Stone was. The death eaters and Voldemort had begun their climb, as the stone interferes people from warping or flying. Harry snuck into the castle, and was searching for his friends. Along the way he sneaked past the potion storage, were Lucius was inspecting things in stock. Harry had to be careful to dodge the sight of people walking around the damp and greenish lit potion storage room. He finally got to the other side of the room and opened the door, and ended up in a stair case area. There were two paths, one led up to a door on the left, and the other led to the right further up the high tower. As harry raced up the stairs he came to an opening, and saw the stone stair case that led upwards, and he realized he would not be able to reach Voldemort in time. He called for his broom and races upward, hoping to catch them. He was noticed and he was then under fire by enemy attacks. He dodged and weaved, but lost control due to the magical energy being given off by the stone. He was flung off his broom and fell thousands of feet downward, he looked up to see that Voldemort was about to touch the stone, but one of the death eaters then attacked Voldemort, and I realized it was Ron and Hermione. Ron fought off the death eaters, and Hermione jumped off the edge and tried to warp donward to catch harry. She was then shot with a killing curse as she warped, and she appeared next to harry dead.  Ron was then knocked off the platform. Harry was in shock, he realized that both of them had just sacrificed themselves for his cause, and Hermione just died trying to save him. He saw Voldemort had touched the stone, and the stone then glowed as bright as the sun, and a shock wave sent harry even faster into the ground. An explosion rocked the earth, and Hogwarts shook as a explosion that looked like an expanding sun consumed, the area. Harry realized that the stone must have reacted violently to Voldemort touch, and triggered a release of the stones awesome power all at once. In front of harry was a wall of fire catching up to him. Below him was the ground, soon to meet him. Harry closed his eyes, but then remembered Hermiones time turner that she had given him before they split up. He pulled it out and started turning it. Once, twice, and a third time. Then he remembered he would not be affected by the reversal. To his surprise, the time turner slowed down time around him, and he landed on the ground softly. Hermiones body flashed upwards. But time was rewinding at a much slower pace, it was not a blur. Instead the sun was contracting slowly, and in a bubbly motion, as if resisting the reversal of time itself. Harry hurried back to the Hogwarts gate while time was reversing, seeing pieces of rocks and stone being placed back into the ground like puzzle pieces, as they had been sucked up into the sun. Hogwarts was slowly rebuilding itself. Harry ran up the stairs, and came to the potion room were lucius was now walking backwards from aisle to aisle with potions flying off the shelf's and into his hands. He then realized that he should not have been here, and that using the magical radiation from the stone’s sunburst, he could in fact alter the flow of time. He went out the door, but for some reason went to the left door. He was surprised to see Hermione and Ron, and that they had been locked up in the room. They had been planning to bust out later and switch with a death eater to stop Voldemort. Harry cried to them about how he had saw their deaths in the future time line and how Hermione had sacrificed herself trying to safe him. Hermione said it was something she would do. They developed a new plan, and harry told Ron, to call his cousin, who was a Dwarf. The Dwarf would bring His Typhoon-class submarine through the river and break into the hogwartz dungeons, freeing the rest of the people from Hogwarts. They did so, and they went outside the room with a new plan. They gathered other prisoners, and prepared to take down Voldemort and his death eaters once and for all. Harry smashed through stone walls to find his other friends, and the three transformed into bats to get around easier. They would stop the dark lord and save Hogwarts."
,"I was walking on a mountain path. To my right was a ridge that dropped down, to my left was the mountain side. When I looked down the ridge, I saw actions being completed in a cycle on loop. I walked down the ridge, and I saw a machine picking up leaves and moving them. There were multiple piles of leaves. The piles would grow bigger, then reset to none, and then grow bigger again. Time was being looped like a GIF in specific spaces. Further down the mountain, I saw a gondoala with large compartments, looping around on a track. The compartments were big enough to fit a mobile house. I went inside one of them through a rooftop hatch, and saw people living in it. Further down the mountain side, I saw a colonial town. I saw streams of people carrying American Artifacts like the liberty bell on wagons. Some groups were the same people and artifact, but in a different action. It was showing a time loop, but with paradoxes of the same instance, being altered slightly in each iteration. For example, one wagon broke down, but an identical one did not. As I went further inward past the road with the wagons, I came to a town square. The circle had a fountain, and there were shops that surrounded it in a U shape. As a baker came outside his shop, I saw German WWII planes fly over and bombs hit the town square. All around me this was happening. AA guns were firing into the air. I ran the other way, and saw that the scene then looped itself again. I climbed all the way back up the hill. I was now in Tokyo. I saw an old women trying to sell a car, and that after selling it, rewinding time with the money in her hand, allowing her to profit over and over again. I went back to my house, which is on a hill and looks like my real house."
,"I was at this university. I was with my friend, who was harry potter for some reason. My professor was analyzing the contents of the data card I gave him in the theater room we were in, which was like a grand play theater with Golden Doric columns. There was a projecter showing the encoded text from the data card. While this was happening I was jumping really high with Harry, as we were able to jump with low Gravity. Then later on, I went with harry to get a new phone from a Version store. We drove to the store at a plaza, but when we went inside the store, the shopkeepers were making out and they looked at us said that they were on their coffee break and to come back later. Harry looked angry, so I told him that we should go get some coffee instead. After eating at Dunkin Donuts, we went outside. Suddenly Harry saw a death eater get into a red van. Harry jumped into the back of the van, and so did I. The van started moving, and it went into the woods besides the plaza, and the forest got thicker and denser. The car stopped and the man got out. We were outside a massive Gothic cathedral. Harry went up to it and opened the doors. We then came face to face Voldermort sitting on a throne in the back of the cathedral. Before him was a table with many death eaters. Harry stammered as Voldemort looked up and grinned at him. I was the one to actually react and I took out a twisted spoon, since I used spoons instead of wands, to send a shock wave that  flipped the front table over. I ran with Harry out the door and started shutting the cathedral door with magic, but Voldemort immediately started opening the door with his own wand. I told Harry to stand back. And I lifted up my Spoon and a torrent of water arose from the ground creating a whirlpool around me. Other death eaters were trying to break through it. So I had to make the water thicker and thicker. I then shot lighting up into the air, and this blasted away the thick trees branches as the bolt went into the sky. The whirlpool grew bigger. I then shouted and called forth the The Great Leviathan Dragon. A huge bolt of lighting struck down and almost hit me. I was shot out of the whirlpool next to harry. The Great Leviathan Dragon rose, and swept up all of the death Eaters in a hurricane of water. Voldemort was trying to hit the dragon with the killing curse, but the shot kept being blasted away. The dragon was not a serpent like normal, it had a long neck and a tail, but it also had huge arms and legs. I asked harry that since Voldemort was not immortal any more, he could be killed. The dragon sent lighting currents through the whirlpool, shocking and killing some death eater who were trapped in the water. I teleported out of there with harry. We were back at the university which apparently was also Hogwarts. I went with harry to tell head master Mcgonagol. She was in her room crying over a picture of Dumbledore. Harry kindly knocked and explained to her what had happened. Then lighting outside the school flashed. And the front gate was busted open, and death eaters poured in. Harry said he would find Voldemort and kill him and he ran off. Mcgonagol went to go assemble the other teachers. I ran into Neville Longbottom and he told me that he had set traps up, and that the underground passages were only available to them, and that it was rigged for anyone else. It was useful during the battle for Hogwarts. On the stair case, I ran into Malfoy, and he told me to help out with the front liners, while he got the rest of the dorms together. I went over to the front entrance area to see that Crabb and Goyle had been cursed and were fused together. A group of death eaters were torturing them. I jumped down from the balcony and impaled a death eater with pig tails through the head. The other death eaters pulled out their wands, and I pulled out one spoon, and I fired a killing curse at a female death eater, killing her instantly, and I then pulled out a second spoon and fired a shock wave that blew them all back. One death eater hid behind a corner and started shooting from there. I lunged through the air to close the distance, and kneed him in the chin. His head snapped back ward. I used the incinreation spell and he lit on fire, followed by the destruction spell(Reducto) and a chunk of his burning body was blown away. Then I chased after a fleeing death eater, and swept his feet. My two spoons turned into a sword of fire and a sword of ice. The male death eater sat up, and was met with my flaming sword an inch from his face. I recognized him, he was one of my old freinds. I said I was disappointed in him and I slashed his top head off with the sword of ice. I went back to the front entrance to see that Voldemort had brought massive ogres. I gave the biggest one a power bar, and he agreed to join me, and he then killed the other two. I took him to the kitchen where all the food was, and he started eating. Voldemort then fled."
,"I was in a world exactly like earth, but a tragedy struck. Hitler had been reincarnated as a brilliant young Aryan boy, who was cunning in his ability to create and control a Nazi zombie army. We heard news that Hitler had trapped the pope in the Vatican and then transformed everyone in Italy into zombies. My family had to flee our home. We escaped through a zeppelin, which I flew. We managed to escape to a place, that looked exactly like our home. Inside there were many boxes with things in them. We were safe for a little while. Then a German Zombie hound appeared outside our driveway, I tried to kill it, but it howled and alerted the horde. I snapped its neck, and I ran inside and told my family to pack things up, and that we needed to move. We packed the boxes and got onto the zeppelin. As we were taking off we were shot buy catpulted zombies. We manged to take off with minimal, damage. But then flying Kung-fu animals attacked the zeppelin. We managed to shoot them down using the Gun turrets, but then while I was piloting the helm and looking through the glass hexagonal dome, a zombie werewolf smashed through the window. I punched it in the stomach, and blasted a hole through his chest. Then I blew him out the window using a shock wave. We managed to relocate near Veince, and while there. I was running through a slum town, being chased by little children zombies. I lost them in the bay area, by climbing a massive bouy. In the horizon, in the center of Veince, I saw the tower of Babel, with searchlights on top of it. I could hear Hitler insulting me with remarks. Later we relocated, to the Artic, but were still chased by Zombies.",
"My family was driving down a highway at dawn, we were trying to located our lost seagull. The landscape around us was lit up like neon, but it was a natural environment, like the dessert. We used google maps to look for a restaurant, and we were able to see a hidden location. The restaurant was a magical tavern run by witches. It was made of wood and was dimly lit. There were many people drinking and talking at tables. There was a cauldron in the back, and a witch was stirring it. She made us a potion that would allows us to locate our pet. As we drove into the night we managed to locate our pet seagull, but as we reclaimed her a massive spider robot came down from the sky from a UFO. We set up laser turrets and defended ourselves from the wave of spider robots. Then we escaped. We set up a tower defense base some place else. But our base was destroyed by a laser that sliced through the bases defenses due to a giant moon sized space station that was orbiting earth. The base was controlled by an Evil republic, that was actually a dictatorship. The aliens had established a new trade route with earth and where importing very cheap clothing with high tariffs rates. There plan was to monopolize clothing on earth. We invaded the mechanical moon. In the city, I found a blacksmith that worked for the government. He was in a cell making coins. He told me that he used to have a lot of work, but the government took the work away and made him mint coins for them. He gave us the keys to the presidents base. I arrive at the entrance of the presidents room along with two comrades. When we walked in. We were then looking up at a massive green house dome, that was like Jurassic park. In front of us was the skeleton and skull of a massive dragon, the size of a building. Out of the skull arose the President riding a White metalic Dragon with Blue eyes. I grabbed a sword and shield. With the help of my friends, I was able to slash the soft under side of the dragon. After killing the dragon and the president, all of the Republics forces were after us. We escaped through the forest of the green house to get to the back of the moon base.  We were attacked by plant monsters, but a flaming man saved us and burned them down and cleared a path. We exited the base, and jumped into a Gunship that picked us up. Then we made our getaway."
,"I am walking amongst a fascist state. In this world I am walking through some sort of school. The school has a lot of wooden structures. I walk up stairs to the next floor, and down the stairs, all while passing classmates wearing uniforms. I find a booth, or table, with a lot of free candy. My cousins are with me. They tell me that the candy is free, but people will know if you take it and you will get into trouble. They throw the candy out at the end of the day. My cousins and I get onto a School bus. I drive. We go on a crazy ride, first on the highway, and then through rail-cart tunnels. We jump through a flaming hoop and end up back in our town. I arrive back home. I discover the bible. I find out that the bible is banned because of its great power. On the end of the bible is instructions. It has a set of instructions on how to rid the world of evil and bring paradise to earth. I begin the steps."
,"I was sitting in my room trying to get a wink of sleep. I was sharing the room with my roomate. Outside there were some parties going on. As I was sleeping, the wall burst open, and a monster named Crusher came in. He was apart of a group of three minions that belonged to a ringleader who sent him kill me. Crusher, Gnasher, and Slicer were in a tank-like vehicle, that had a skull face that crushed things up in its jaws as it moved. It operated on treads, and it had arms. I jumped up into the air, and slammed into it from above, my roommate hit it from the side. But we could not dent it enough. I was very tired due to a lack of sleep, and could not fully fight. I then pushed myself and I punched the machine backwards. I knocked it back, but it was not good enough. My roommate used a sticky net to bind Crusher to the ground. I pushed myself as hard as I could, and I unleashed a beam that sliced Crusher and killed all three of them I fell down. The wall had magically repaired itself. I looked outside my door, it was still a party outside with people drinking. I asked my roommate if we should rotate the night watch. As he seemed iffy about the idea when all of a sudden, slicer burst through the door still alive. we then had to fight it with sword to sword combat. After putting it down we decided to move out and find a better place. We headed out toward the city via train. As we neared the metropolis, the train screeched to a halt. Up in the sky I saw an invasion force of droids. They were raining down and landing crafts from the sky. Luckily the shield generators were holding their fire. The city sent out Gunships to combat the enemy attacks, and the defensive turrets started firing. We got to the city on foot and the guards let us in along with other civilians. As we walked through the city, with civilians being pushed toward shelter, my roommate and I got separated, as I had other plans, and I left him to go find something. As I walked out into the city, I could see the sky lit up by explosions as the guns were shooting down landing crafts. I separated from my roommate because I needed to do this alone. I was here to kill my long time rival and adversary, a bounty hunter that had tried to take my life multiple times. Boba Fett. He had come here during the midst of all this chaos to kill Mace Windu, who would be no doubt be overseeing the defense of the city. I had an obligation to settle things with Boba. I set out along the streets. The cities were like New York, except they looked like they were made from gold,  not brick, and the windows were blue shining lights. As I ran through the streets, I accidentally ran into a Mecha Godzilla that was mobilizing through the streets. I dodged its feet and jumped ontop of the nearest building to survey the area. That’s when I saw it. In the middle of a barren street intersection, Boba Fett and Mace Windu were dueling there. Just then the cities barrier broke down, and several godzilla kaijus stormed the city. This was not planned, I was relying on the barrier to hold off the enemy force long enough for me to sucker punch Boba. I had a flashback to why Mace Windu was so famous. It was back then, and was the event that killed Bobas father. It was the cheese virus incident. In the city, Bobby Pantsu, an engineer had been responsible for creating drills that could dig deeper into the earth and mine more and more ore. He made the city famous and wealthy. He assistant Patrick, helped him create the cyber drill, capable of boring deeper into the earth, to an insane level never seen before. Bobs new goal was to find ore that no one had seen before. That was his downfall. Bob drilled very deep down and discovered what is now known as the cheese spore. It is a fungi that’s as hard as rock, and would constantly transform any material into its own substance, be it organic and inorganic. However the technology from the cyber drill was immune to its effects, so it bore through the cheese fungi. Bob then went down to see what they had found with Patrick, only to find the cheese fungi. Of course Bob did not know what it was at the time. No one did. It was only when bob touched it, did the Cheese fungi react. What had happened was that the fungi had been trapped between the burning core of the planet, and a layer of molten iron, which burned the fungi, but never fully killed it. This stalemate existed for eons, until that is, when bob broke through the molten iron layer did he create an escape path for the cheese fungi. While the fungi was only able to slowly convert abiotic material, it could immediately swallow and assimilate chemical and biotic material. However by some twisted miracle, bob’s chemical composition was so similar to the cheese fungi, that he was not fully killed. Instead he became the fungi. He expanded upwards and almost killed Patrick had Patrick not been able to get into the elevator in time. As Bob, now a Monolithical blob with just a face in the growing fungi, grew upward, he slowly lost all feeling and reason. When the fungi reached the top it swallowed the factory. The cheese virus was almost not contained if it was not for the fact that Mace Windu was able to forcibly contain it with his power of telekinesis. Only his blade, which was as hot as the sun, could slice through the cheese fungi. The problem was now evident. Patrick worked with Mace to solve the problem. Mace enlisted the help of Jango to secure the area, due to Jangos experience with heavy fire power and military operations. Jango was able to keep the cheese fungi from expanding, by constantly barraging it with firepower. Soon Mace and Pattrick found a solution. The cheese fungi broke up and dissolved on contact with water. But they also found something else, that the breakdown of the cheese fungi released a toxic gas on contact to water. Mace Windu could blow the gas away from the city, but it might effect the town that was to west of the city. Mace believed it was necessary, but Jango disagreed. He had grown up there, it was a place of freedom and adventure. He would not let mace do so. He proposed using the same material of the Cyber drill to seal the cheese fungi, and then safely destroy it that way. Mace believed that there was no time left, and that the firepower would not hold the fungi. Jango argued that there was more ammo being produced around the clock and being shipped. Mace countered that one slip up and we would all be doomed, and that even with his telekinesis he could stop the fungi. Jango took out his gun and fired at Mace striking him in the shoulder. Mace fought back with one arm. They fought for a long time until it came down to Jango having to finish Mace with a HF combat knife. But it was Mace, who even with one arm, managed to stop the blade using his mind, and used his other hand to grab his blade and stab Jango in the neck. After this they managed to dissolve the cheese fungi, and mace blew it into the air over the west world. He hoped that by putting it into the air, it would not effect the town. However it eventually settled on half the town, killing many. Mace was forever hated by one side, and seen as a hero by another side. Patrick found the shriveled corpse of bob in the rubble of the factory, now having no arms or legs, and was barley intelligible. Patrick took out a gun and shot his friend to end his suffering. Back in the present, I was watching the fight below me. Boba too had a rough past as a child, but he wronged me, and so after he got his revenge I would have mine. I headed into the sewers. "
, "I was standing at the edge of a pool. The pool area that I was In was pretty small. It was a 25m pool, with 8 lanes. The ground was rough cement, and so were the walls. The walls had many light stilted windows on two opposite sides. Above me, orange-red support beans lined the ceiling. My coach was standing next to me  I was at a practice. I jumped in, and went after My brother. But I could not catch up to him In fly. Then my rival appeared, and I could not catch up to him either. I was then standing in a hotel courtyard. It was a very luxurious hotel. In front of me was a marble tile walkway, that went through a stone fountain. The water in the fountain was crystal clear. Beside the marble pathway were rectangular trimmed bushes that formed a fence. Around the fountain, I could see a large hotel that was like a tower. It was as tall as a skyscraper. Looking up I could see it was cream colored, with pillars in the front entrance that led to an arched door with an auto sliding door. This building had its corners fluted and massive stone statues of angels and fish clung to the sides of the building like Kaijus. On the inside of the building the rooms where separated by Japanese styled sliding doors. As I walked through, a man in a 70s suit and black hat approached me and told me that my rabbit was in the other room. I followed him through the sliding door and I found a rabbit on a metal table. But the rabbit was a small rabbit, small enough to sit in the palm of your hand. It had a hole through its head, as if it had been shot by a tiny bullet.  It was indeed dead. The man told me I had to fix it. And I took out a scalpel and split the rabbit in half by making an incision from the top of the head. I found that the rabbit had no bones on the inside, only what appeared to be “meat” that looked like ground beef. I took a bag of simliar meat and filled the rabbit up. Then I sewed the rabbit back together. The rabbit came to life and had red beady eyes. It just sat in the palm of my hand looking plump and comfy."
, "I am walking on a grassy field. Behind me is a village that looks like a summer home, and my family is their. The village looks like the summer houses at the Disney Polynesian resort. In front of me, approaching, is the vanguard to an army of a million orcs. They have come to pillage the place. The van guard was 300, or maybe 500 people. I walked up to them. An orc, taller than the other ones, who was 8 feet tall instead of the usual 6, stepped up to me. Unlike the other orcs, who were wider and had fat bellies, this orc was tall, muscular and had a 8 pack. He carried a spiked mace, and had scraps of armor on him. He taunted me for challenging him, I swiped my arm sideways, and his top half was ripped clean off by a blade of wind. Then all of the orcs lunged at me, and I shredded every one of them into atomized blood using blades of wind. I flew up into the air, and I saw an army of a million orcs racing across the plane. I stuck one finger up into the air. I created a super nova and condensed it into a black hole, and threw it at the horde. I could feel the tension of the energy flow through my right arm, fro my shoulder to my finger. It impacted the ground, and sunk through, pulling in orcs from its massive gravitational force. It then exploded creating a blinding flash that wiped out the army. I returned back to the village, and was greeted by a handful of people including my father, but everyone quickly left."
,"I am diving deep into a virtual world. In this world I see the memories of a boy and girl. Their memories create a landscape. One of the boys memories involve paintings of himself on a wall, but they slowly erode and fall off. The girls is wandering through some grassy hills and ponds, next to a house. I then discover the nightmare. It is a world that is trying to stop me from retrieving the pieces of memory by booby trapping all objects with spikes, clamps, pit falls, and what not. I need to stop the “Mother” from escaping the virtual world via the control tower. I gain enough memories to walk into the lake. It is a lake full of a clear flowing water that you can breathe normally under. I take the soul edge, a blade made by a Dark Wizard, with power to slash souls into pieces. I then fly above the landscape and fight the Mother, who is like a giant jelly fish being that glows like its covered in light blue clear moss.  After I hack and slash at it, my attacks break the shield to the control tower, a large floating spacecraft and a part of Mother gets aboard. I get on board as well, and I find myself in the prison tower. I find the king and the baron, who are now possessed by Mother, and I am forced to fight them."
," am standing at the entrance to an empty mall. Pure white plastic floors and walls, and dual escalators in front of me lead to the second floor. The whole lighting is a dim blue light. I am then standing in a freezer room. The metal walls around me have frost on them. The middle of the room has a deep pool of glacial water, with small ice platforms floating in them. A talking sphere made up of ground beef and flesh with a face, talks to me from my pocket. I get fed up with him, and I throw him into the shark infested waters with the ice platforms, and the sharks smell the meat and rip him up. I am then walking in the hallway of a high school, the long hallway of lockers are painted rainbow layered. I see people painting murals of characters on the walls. I am then standing in a marsh, with no trees, just mud. Around me is a playground submerged in mud, and kids are running around playing on it. A wall with signs shows me this is an abandoned world, from a long time ago. I am walking in the mud with my friends, watching the kids. As I step into the mud, my feet sink, and I feel children shoes in the mud, realizing that many died here. This was the Muddy Graveyard of lost Shoes This was an eternal grave yard."
,"am standing in a swimming pool. This pool is massive, with skylights up top that let in yellow sunlight. It has red ribbed beams on the roof. The walls are made of glass, and the pool is Olympic size, with at least 16 lanes. One side has a wall that has the entrance to the locker rooms, announcer stand, swimmer bleachers, and above this wall is bleachers for spectators. As I was swimming, and doing laps. I was accosted by a furry house centipede, 3 inches long. Unlike a normal one, this one was covered I actual yellow fur. It had 20 or so small tails on its thorax that wriggled. It acted like a dog, but I was annoyed by it and shooed it away. As It follow me to the edge of the pool, I got out, and my father put it in my fanny pack bag, and zipped it up, greatly annoying me.  I am then standing in a bedroom. It is like my dorm room, with dark green walls, small, narrow, and I am under the bed. I can hear my roommate.  I try to move, but I am unable to. I realize that I am trying to wake up in real life, and I am failing to do so. I manage to stand up, and wobble over to the door. When I open it, I wake up back in the bed. I am trying to get up but I can’t. I am holding a bag of some candy. It looks and tastes like sour patch.  Then I am standing outside the dorm room door. As I walk forward, down a spiral stair case, it appears that I am not in a dorm room door, but in a house. As I walk down this stair case I see that I am now in a small foyer with grey walls. A man with spiky black hair, black shirt, grey pants muscular body, red eyes, and eyes shadow comes down from another stair case. I recognize him as someone who is supposed to be a dormmate. I tell him that its not safe here. He then transforms into monster, and tries to make me scared. But I am not. He is not unfettered and walks up to my face and jeers me, I can feel his breath on my face. In annoyance, I punch him and he goes flying down the hallway. I reappear behind him and I break his spine with an upward kick. I walk outside the building, and find that I am now in a large resort like area, with pools, greenery, hedges, fences, and I can see a highway bridge in the distance. I realize that no matter where I look or go, my brain is constantly generating a new image on the fly as I explore the resort, making it endless.  After this, I am marching down a street. I break into a prison house, which looks like a locker room with some vending machines. I free some of the prisoners, and beat others who defy me. They join me on my march, and I claim that we shall march to the capital and overthrow the government. As I am marching I come across a massive blockade, where high-tech tanks have blocked the road, including Missle battery trucks. They all open fire, and I see missiles rain down from the sky. I hold out my hand, and an invisible barrier blocks the thousands of shell rounds and explosions from me and my group. I then wave my hand, and the top half of the tanks and vehicles explode, and I flick my hand upward and they are launched into the sky."
