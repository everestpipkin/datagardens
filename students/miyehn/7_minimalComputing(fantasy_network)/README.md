# Flesh Chat

A (hypothetical) message sending tool that is made possible by the help of small animals.

Created by [Connie Ye](https://connieye.com/) and [Rain Du](https://miyehn.me)

### How it works

To send a message (an image) with Flesh Chat, the sender encodes an image with dots and line segments connecting them, and let many small animals physically send the encoded image, each carrying only a small piece of the entire message. 

This is an effort to secure private communication for the time of quantum computing, when all modern digital encryptions lose effect because they can be quickly hacked by quantum computers. In the age of quantum computing, digital communication will no longer be private.

With Flesh Chat, it's hard for anyone other than the receiver to recover the original message, as they don't know which animals are carrying pieces of the message.

### Inspirations

### Usage

#### Sending message

Go to [the sending side](https://send-message.glitch.me/) (built by Connie).

Click on the paper on the desk, choose an image file to encode, and encode it as directed by the interface.

Click on the pile of stickers on the left to prepare for sending messages. Then click on the stickers laid out on the desk to write pieces of the message down. 

Finally, drag the stickers onto any of the animals (flies, rats and birds) to send the message!

#### Receiving message

Go to [the receiving side](https://receive-message.glitch.me/) (built by Rain).

You may see the animals coming in over time. This means you have a message to receive. You can hover over each individual animal to see what piece of information it carries, but it's often not helpful for figuring out the entire message.

You have to wait until the special piece of information arrives- the one that tells you how to connect the dots, before you can click on the paper on the desk, and click on the animals to plot down the information each of them carry.

Then you can finally piece together pieces of information by drawing to connecting the dots as directed.
