            "review_body": "This holds a curl beautifully and lengthens wonderfully. Lightly sweeping thin layers of the mascara on is the best for me to avoid clumps when initially applying it. Everything makes me cry so I'm always getting this stuff wet and judging from how it looks right now (after a 2 hour nap and a half hour of a hard core crying sesh) it handles itself well- still holds at least 65% of the curl and at least 50% of the applied length and 99% of the black colour is still there. It only becomes a bit clumpy when I cry but it's cool- reapplying one layer of this stuff helps get it back to its original state. This stuff can smudge a lot under your eye ONLY if it's oily under there so just apply some translucent powder if that's ever a problem for you.",

            "review_body": "To start off, I have really watery and sensitive eyes, so I can only wear waterproof mascara. This is the reason why I had kind of given up on high end mascaras because for some reason, drugstore mascaras seem to be the only ones that know what waterproof means. Still, I was curious about the Better Than Sex Mascara when they made a waterproof version and on vacation I bought the travelsized version to test it. The first thing I noticed was that this mascara makes my lashes look the most beautiful they have ever looked. It also is the only mascara I have ever tried that I need only one coat of. But even after two coats, it doesn't clump and I have curved, defined, volumous, even longer, actually black lashes. I fell instantly in love! The second thing that I noticed that I had slight raccoon eyes after I sprayed myself with setting/sunblock-spray. So I was terribly disappointed and thought that this wasn't really waterproof. After having worn this mascara for 2 weeks now, I can say that it is actually pretty waterproof. It survived very hot days and a sad movie with lots of crying on my part. Here are the things that I have learned though: a) this mascara takes relatively long to dry, and while drying it is not waterproof/transferproof yet. So no settingspray while the mascara isn't dry yet. b)setting powder under the eyes! Because the mascara is waterproof, but not oilproof, so if you have oily skin or use something oily like sunscreen, the mascara is going to come off on the oily places. c) for some reason, this mascara is much easier to remove than the drugstore mascaras I am used to, so less rubbing is really nice for my sensitive eyes!",

            "review_body": "Let's talk about the uses for this mascara. This is a great mascara for people who NEED waterproof mascara such as swimmers. This is probably not a great mascara for people who are looking for an everyday mascara that won't smudge or run. I personally only use this mascara if I know that I might go swimming or cry. The pros - This mascara sticks to your lashes like superglue. It will NOT budge the rest of the day and probably the rest of the week too. I could probably wear it during the zombie apocalypse and still come out with no smudging. -It's super volumizing, black and lengthens really well too. It makes you look like you're wearing falsies. The cons: -This mascara takes some getting used too. It is a very wet formula and there's a ton of product on the brush. I would strongly recommend combing out your lashes with a spoolie if it seems there is too much product. -It takes a long time to dry (approximately 15 min), probably because the formula is so wet. (This is probably a good thing it's so wet because it won't dry out quickly in the tube.) -It's incredibly hard to remove. There's a reason why this is sold with a special remover. Overall, this is an amazing waterproof mascara. If you're looking for \"THE waterproof mascara\" then buy this!! It will not budge. If you're looking for just a volumizing mascara, it's probably better to just stick to the original BTS or another nice mascara.",

I had a stressful moment at work recently and a few tears sneaked out of my eyes, so I went to the bathroom to wipe the raccoon streaks from under my eyes...and there weren't ANY.

While in the store, I asked the advice of the salesperson who overwhelming suggested I go with this one. Big mistake. Was excited to try it at home. As soon as I opened the cap, the product looked messy as it oozed out of the container. It was like a thick paste, gloopy, and sticky- not at all the amazing product I'd heard about. The brush was way too bulky, not good for precision. It coated my lashes making them stick together but did little to separate them. The product stung my eyes and made me cry, which created an even bigger mess. I tried to apply an additional coat,but it did nothing- no extra volume. The entire look was sloppy. Maybe if you have long, thick lashes to begin with this product works but if you have thin, wispy lashes, the product is WAY TOO THICK. You couldn't even see the individual lashes. And after removing it with 2 rounds of eye makeup remover, and a cleansing towelette, I still woke up with black gunk under my eyes. I get MUCH better results with brands I've purchased at the drugstore after 3 coats. I wish I had gone with my gut and bought one of the other mascaras I read about. This one is definitely getting returned.",

It volumises like no other mascara ever could. It also is amazing at adding length and curl and definition. It dries pretty quickly, but I always save mascara as the last step in my makeup routine so I don't have to worry about it. It is also the strongest waterproof I have ever experienced in a mascara. I can sob uncontrollably and look in the mirror afterward and not have to reapply because my mascara has not budged. It doesn't run or clump or anything!!! I mean, come the end of the day, it is a beast to get off, but I've got a great makeup remover, so I don't mind (Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, I swear by them!). Two critiques: If I wear concealer under my eyes, I do get a little bit of black gunk under my eyes by the end of the day, but if I don't wear foundation, or if I keep up my powder application throughout the day, I don't run into this problem. It's never too hard to wipe off. It comes off pretty easily with my finger, no smudging. And OH, how I wish this mascara came in BROWN. That's not really a critique, but I really do wish I had this is in brown for those days I feel like looking really natural. I recommend this mascara to anyone and everyone. It is my one true love.

The waterproof aspect is okay. I've tested it out swimming a few times and it stays on (though you lose some curl, obviously). Since it has fibers, it can flake a little.

Everyone asks how my marathon finishline photos look so good... 1) smile for the camera and 2) care about how you look. Wearing makeup, namely this awesome mascara, does NOT slow your race pace... does not make you sink to the bottom of the ocean floor... it makes you look smokin' hot and camera ready on a whim.",

I'm a big fan.",

It's remained put on humid, sweaty days and even teary occasions which I appreciate. It has not flaked off on me and is one of the few mascaras I know I wont have to touch up or worry about traveling on my face during the day. This product is mostly directed towards people who worry about water smudges (tears/humidity/pools ect). For myself I did not notice a finished look that make my lashes thicker or longer. This gives a look of natural lashes and its soft to the touch. I love long lashes so I typically help out this mascara by using my Tarte eyelash curler. General FYI - if your planning on purchasing make sure you have a waterproof eye makeup remover. This WILL make you lose lashes while your scrubbing it off with a normal facial cleanser.

I keep trying mascaras, hoping to find one that lasts longer, plus has a waterproof version just as good. I came back to this mascara (both waterproof and non-waterproof), because I haven't been able to find another one that lasts longer. Having to replace a tube of mascara every few weeks can be rather expensive, which is why I keep trying. I might find something that seems really good, but then the tube might not make it even three weeks, and I just don't want to pay that much money on a regular basis. I have friends who can go two months on a tube of mascara.\n\nHaving used this in the past, I knew it does an awesome job defining my lashes. The brush is good - it gets most of my lashes with one coat, and I go back and get the rest with a spherical brush. This brush is well designed to reach even small lashes. It gives me a well defined excellent effect. The staying power of this mascara is really good, and I wear it when I know I'll cry - weddings, graduations, water sports, sad movies... This mascara is great and creates some serious lash definition. The only reason I stopped wearing this was that the non-waterproof version didn't last long enough, and I ended up trying other things. A lot of other things...\n\nWell, I'm back to this mascara for day wear when I need a waterproof mascara. (I like the Iconic at night when I want my lashes to fan out).\n\nThis is an excellent mascara. It lasts a very long time once applied, doesn't smear or smooth, and it doesn't run when I cry. I'm really pleased with it for my long lashes. I have friends who have very short sparse lashes who use this, along with the non-waterproof version, and it does awesome things for them, so I know this works for me, with my long lashes, and for them, with their short ones. It's really good and it's dependable. I highly recommend this mascara when you need one that's waterproof.\n\nPS Waterproof mascaras are supposedly healthier, anyway, compared to their non-waterproof versions. because product doesn't rub off on skin or get into eyes.",

That said, there was too much clumping (something you wouldn't expect to find at this price range), making application less than appealing. Honestly, the product would mostly transfer onto my lashes in clumps, and would leave them sticking together. Horrible. Also, this particular mascara felt very dry on my eyes and irritated them a lot (itching, tears). Gave it a good few weeks hoping my eyes would adjust to it, but never did. Sadly, the disappointment continued when the mascara dried out too quickly in the bottle, leaving me with little to any product to use. Wouldn't recommend this based on my experience.",

I was a little hesitant in getting DiorShow because of the price \u2013 but it was worth EVERY PENNY!\n\nThis mascara did not run, smudge or flake at all the day my tears were flowing for 12+ hours. What I loved most about it was the brush and the ease of putting it on. The brush was fuller than Clinique\u2019s high impact, so I got longer, fuller, thicker lashes. I couldn\u2019t believe it stayed put all day. I read the other reviews about the flaking and that didn\u2019t happen to me at all. You don\u2019t need numerous coats either, just brush it through until all lashes are evenly coated \u2013 it looks like professionally done lashes after application. I\u2019m so glad I went with this product, and equally as glad that it did what it was supposed to.",

No black lines running down my face.\n\nIt's not difficult to remove with make up removerm, either. I've jused drug store brands in the past that were like plastered to my eyelashes. Ridiculous! Dior really has a great line of products.\n\nI also use the DiorShow Mazimizer lash plumping serum before I apply the mascara, and I must say, my eyelashes are amazing! If you're looking for volume and length, I suggest both products.\n\nI have not had any clumping with it and it doesn't seem dry to me.",

It did come off easily with make-up remover however, which was great.\nAnother plus: it creates a smooth line (as thin or as thick as you'd like), even if you don't have a particularly steady hand (I don't). Definitely superior to any other liquid or \"pen\" eyeliner I've ever tried.

I suffer from dry eye, and while no make-up will ever beat the battle of the tears, Kat Von D's eyeliner comes close. There is so much to love about this eyeliner. #1. The formula is well made. The liner stays on my eyes until I take it off and it comes off easily with make-up remover or cleansing oil. #2. The brush tip. I used to use Stila's eyeliner pen but constantly found the felt tip to be a massive drawback. The brush tip on Kat's eyeliner is perfection. It is made of tons of small hairs that never...and I mean never...get misshapen or dull. This is a godsend for those like me who rock cat eyes on a daily basis. #3. The product last FOREVER. I typically have each pen for 6 months or more and that's with daily use. Strong pigmentation and a serious bang for your buck. I've honestly never bought a product that was such an amazing return on investment. The price almost seems too low for how much product you actually get and with how well made the material attributes of the tube are. #4. Dries quickly. Unlike liquid eyeliner, you don't have to wait to open your eye for fear of smearing the liner into your crease. This stuff is like superglue. Set it and forget it...wait...that's the rotisserie machine... Anyways, as I was saying, this stuff dries quickly making it easier to finish up your make-up without fear of smudging. If you do make a mistake, it's easy to clean up with some make-up remover and a Q-Tip (I recommend Make Up Forever's sensitive eye remover. It's blue and so kind to your eyes. God bless it.)\n\nOh yeah, and it's waterproof. Like, legitimately waterproof. I have gone swimming and sweated and it hasn't budged.\n\nI know this was long winded but I really wanted to prove to you how quality this product is. I wouldn't write such a long review if I didn't have so much love for this product. I recommend it to everyone.",

This liner is great - it has great opacity, is very waterproof, has a great applicator that allows for high precision, and doesn't smudge. For any of the previous comments to be true, it is VITAL to let it dry first; if, for example, your eyes are sensitive and tend to tear up when you're applying makeup, the tears might make it smudge away if it still isn't dry. It's got plastic bristles on the applicator, which is great for precision, as opposed to the sponge ones. The only complaint I have about this liner (and the reason I gave it 4stars) is because it tends to dry out temporarily which makes it difficult and frustrating to apply, and the product tends to dry and build up near the base of the applicator.

Finding this primer was a revelation---it kept my liquid liner (for reference, Kat Von D tattoo liner) in place through tears and in-climate weather and even swimming. I can say that these two products were some of the only makeup products I've encountered that NEVER let me down. Completely reliable.\n\nBut now! :( The Urban Decay primer is still okay---works well enough about 70% of the time. But when I'm at a party and someone has to tell me I have some creased eye makeup (after only wearing it for a few hours)... not acceptable. Until they bring back the old formula, it's onto the next product. Sigh, it was nice knowing you Urban Decay.",

The color is very strong, which is perfect for some added drama. When first applied it is possible to smudge it which is ok because when you make a mistake it's easily fixable. Once dried the product becomes a little flakey, so if you do end up crying or what have you it won't smear your tears will be covered in flakes though. This stands up well too heat and cold (where I live the temps range from -40f to 90f), and as long as you don't have very moist eyes there's no reason this producer wouldn't last you all day.",

Granted, I'm pretty sure my eyelids are quite dry. The only issue with this eyeliner is that it isn't waterproof AT ALL (which is sort of a big problem because waterproof is part of the product's name but whateva...) If you have oilier eyelids, are going out in the rain, or cry a lot, this is NOT the eyeliner for you.

But I love the liquid eyeliner look so I do this trick. I love the Stila liquid eyeliner so I do my eyes with that first - after primer and eyeshadow- and let it dry. Then I sharpen my tarte sex kitten eyeliner to a nice point and go overtop the stila liner very carefully. THIS combo is actually waterproof-my eyes constantly water especially in cold weather and this stays put. This way I get the look of liquid with the waterproof-ness of the crayon. And if you really want it to stay, top off with eyeshadow  over top, I use a fine eyeliner brush to make sure I stay in the original lines. This stays put through crying and everything.

There is only one problem with this eyeliner: if I don't let it dry enough, it will start sticking to the skin just above my eyelid crease, which is not only annoying but leads to smudging. I've never had to specifically let an eyeliner dry before, so it's kind of odd. But I just use that time to carefully do my brows and eyelashes, so it's not a big deal to me.",

Personally, I see this as a sign so I got emotional and I cried. Then I got angry at myself because I had done my makeup and I was going to have to fix it because even though my mascara and eyeliner are waterproof, they always run. I was surprised to see that my makeup was intact. I recently bought this setting spray and I can tell you that it does the job.

            "review_body": "Product: Urban Decay Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray (29.00 for 4.0 fluid ounces)\nShade: Clear\n\n>> I didn't expect much when I got this, especially because I've never tried setting sprays before. Urban Decay claimed a lot of things about this, and usually I don't list what the company says, but just take a look...\n\n>> What it does: It's the new final step to your makeup routine! This weightless, super-fine mist holds foundation, eyeshadow, blush, and concealer in place so that makeup looks picture-perfect all day long. Temperature Control Technology prevents makeup from a melt down when it's warm and avoids makeup dehydration and cracking when it's cold. All Nighter works expertly on all skin types and prevents loss of color, melting, sliding, caking, cracking, excess shininess, fading blush, eyeshadow, and lip color disappearance. AND it's formulated to resist moisture, so you can fearlessly sweat, cry, or get your Jacuzzi on\u2014you're guaranteed makeup that always looks just-applied, without ever feeling sticky or tight. Backed by years of science, All Nighter is simply unlike any other product available and keeps you looking flawless with just a couple sprays on top of your makeup.\n\n>> What else you need to know: All Nighter is allergy tested, dermatologist tested, vegan, cruelty free, and free of oil, parabens, and fragrance.\n\n>> Research Results: 81.8% of customers say product gave makeup a healthy glow. 78.8% of customers said product helped makeup avoid creasing. 75.7% of customers said makeup looked as good at end of the day as at the beginning of the day.\n\n>> Wow. A spray that is lightweight, super-fine, sets eye makeup, sets face makeup, sets lip makeup, uses temperature control technology, works on all skintypes, prevents de-pigmentation, prevents melting, prevents sliding, prevents caking, prevents cracking, prevents shine, prevents fading, prevents creasing, resists moisture, gives a healthy glow, and makes makeup look the same at the end of the day.\n\n>> Um... is it just me or is that a TON to offer! After reading that mouthful I was very skeptical of this product. Was Urban Decay just \"fluffing\" up the description. I was wrong. This spray really does all of that, I really wish I could just give this an A++++++++ to the millionth power. I was so surprised at how awesome this stuff is, anyways into the in-depth review.\n\n>> This spray is created by Urban Decay but uses formulations from Skindinanvia, or a brand that specifically creates setting sprays. I received this in a small bottle and followed the instruction by simply shaking and then spraying on the face. I like to make sure that everything is always even, so even though the bottle says spray 2-4 times I might of sprayed 5-8 times very lightly to make sure my whole face was covered. When I was spraying this on I thought it would feel very sticky or gooey on the face, or basically uncomfortable. Instead it felt like I was misting very \"finely milled... water\" on my face. The spray is very thin and feels as light as air on the face, as if you're running through a park in the early morning. Just a fine amount of dew on the face, very refreshing. The spray takes about 10-15 seconds to dry depending on how much you applied. So, overall the application was easy and the spray felt very refreshing. I noticed a slight 'sugary' fragrance, even though this is fragrance free; so maybe it's my imagination. Overall it just smells (not a bad thing) just when spraying; but the all of the scent disappears after it dries.\n\n>> Just to make it clear, I've seen people on Youtube spray this before applying makeup. According to the bottle you spray it on AFTER you apply makeup, so make sure you use it after makeup application. It will not work as well if you apply it beforehand because you are simply \"setting\" your natural skin. If you do have dry or oily skin setting beforehand can help makeup application go on easier though.\n\n>> Now here came the true test, to see if my makeup stayed on all day and really did the things that Urban Decay listed it did. After a 14 hour day, none of my makeup had changed. (Urban Decay claimed that this stuff works for 16 hours, and I believe them.) My makeup looked exactly the same. Obviously this didn't do anything for my tightline because the spray can't magically fly into my eye and along the inner rims. All my eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, concealer, tinted moisturizer, blush, highlighter, lip stain, etc. seemed to have stayed in-tact. It literally looked the same as it did when I had applied it in the morning. For temperature control these past weeks have been relatively cold because of winter. I didn't notice any flaking at all (score!), since I have dry skin this was surprising. (I was thinking of buying the version for dry skin, know as Dew Me, but this works fine. They also have a version for oily skin known as De-Slick.) I did test this out when I went out on a jog, and I noticed that my makeup didn't melt off and my skin didn't feel uncomfortable, (score again!).\n\n>> I can definitely see how this works on all skin types. I have slight combination skin meaning half of the time my skin can be normal. (No oil, no dry patches) While other times I can have lots of oil and blocked pores in my T-Zone, or forehead, nose, and chin. I will also have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nose also. This didn't disturb my skin type by making me any oilier or any drier, which is nice to know. If you have severely oily or severely dry skin I recommend trying out Dew Me or De-Slick, which are the same things but are formulated for certain skin types. I noticed that it did prevent all the things above, de-pigmentation (fading), melting, sliding, caking, cracking, creasing, bla bla bla. My makeup did look the same as it did in the morning and my skin had a soft healthy glow, something like a lit from within appearance. As you can see this setting spray is amazing and I apply it on to all of my makeup looks that I wear outside.\n\nEffectiveness: 10/10\nValue: 10/10\nPackaging: 10/10\nEase Of Use: 10/10\nOverall: 10/10\n\nGrade: A+\nOne of the best products I have ever tried. Truly.",

Other than lipgloss (which was expected) we didn't have to touch up even after 12 hours! By the time it was time to take it off, my makeup still looked beautiful.\n\nThe bride and I have dry skin and another bm who used this has combo/oily skin and it does seem to work for all our skin types. If you have really dry or really oily skin, the UD website has 2 other kinds of setting sprays you can choose from but I chose this one for our bridal party.\n\nGranted, it wasn't too hot or too humid or rainy outside so I have no idea how this works against the elements. Also, all us girls miraculously were able to hold in our tears (I suppose we were just too harried and busy to cry) so I also am not sure how this spray would hold up to that. But I know that using this definitely can't hurt--after all, I have never gone 12 hours without touching my makeup before--until I used this.",

I used Pink of Me as a full lid base, with Earthquake as a winged liner, and OHHHH BABY, Hot fire.

From sweating to crying it stayed on all day and partial night until I took it off. KEPT MY LASHES LOOKING LONG AND LUCIOUS WITHOUT HAVING TO CURL THEM !!!! Although if I had to have one bad thing to say it would probably have to be I\u2019d you\u2019ve applied your skin care routine and any residue is left on the lashes it\u2019s best to wipe them clean and apply the mascara after !",

This beautiful non-pastey, scentless and weightless formula gives a natural look with the help of a long wand! The formula is weightless when applied to your lashes and provides great separation. It owns up to its name by not smudging or coming off with water (or tears!)",
