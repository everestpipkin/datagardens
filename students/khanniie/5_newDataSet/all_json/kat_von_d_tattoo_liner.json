         "description":"I've been an avid user of liquid liner for almost a decade and people seem to always ask me how I get it so precise. I tell them its taken me years but with this product, this could be your first time with eyeliner application and it will come as close to perfection as you can get.\n\nThe shape and felt tip make it so effortlessly to apply. It basically feels like your just holding a normal pen and it only applies where you want it to. The tip helps you control the thickness of your lines.\n\nDoes not smudge or crease. Anything I apply to my eyes has a great risk of creasing because of my small eyelid, but it stays in place all day through anything. I work in an environment where water splashes are common as well as hot steam, and it does not move.\n\nThis product is very long lasting. I usually have to buy a new liner every 3 to 4 weeks because I use it a lot. I wear this eyeliner 6 out of 7 days. But with the tattoo liner, I am still on my first one and I purchased it about 8 weeks ago and I don't plan on buying a new one for a while because its not near to running out yet. This is saving me tons of money!…read more"

         "title":"Essentially the BEST LINER OUT THERE",
         "description":"I've never written a review on here, but this deserves one.\n\nLet me preface this with the fact that I'm Asian, have slightly hooded eyelids, which are pretty oily --- absolutely nothing can stay on them. I don't care how waterproof something says it is, nothing will stay on. My eyes are just difficult. From mascara, to eyeshadow, to liner --- everything comes off in about two (2) hours and I look like a raccoon.\n\nMy method: No matter what, I always prep with Urban Decay, and then do a sealing with a neutral eyeshadow over any liner and things will stay on for six (6) hours max.\n\nBefore this, I was using the Stilia waterproof liner (which I will also sing accolades about because it was my HG for a while before I found this one). It was almost perfect, but was just slightly not as great.\n\nFound that this one had a similar application tip and tried it on a whim because it was called the Tattoo liner --- I was pretty skeptical because I didn't know if I thought a reality star could have a fab makeup line, but the staying power for this is great.\n\nI definitely still need to do all the steps from prime to sealing with eyeshadow, but with those steps I can basically sleep in this and it'll stay 90% on. The 10% that does come off is fading, and does not cause the raccoon effect.\n\nALSO, this is freakin' foolproof!!!!! I love makeup, but my technique is lousy at best. But with the ease and glide of this liner, I can almost always make the perfect cat-eye line. Start from the outside and fill-in!\n\nThis is my HG, and anyone would be hard-pressed to find better one.…read more"

         "title":"Great product, minor issues..",
         "description":"I have only tried this product in Trooper (black). This liner is great - it has great opacity, is very waterproof, has a great applicator that allows for high precision, and doesn't smudge. For any of the previous comments to be true, it is VITAL to let it dry first; if, for example, your eyes are sensitive and tend to tear up when you're applying makeup, the tears might make it smudge away if it still isn't dry. It's got plastic bristles on the applicator, which is great for precision, as opposed to the sponge ones. The only complaint I have about this liner (and the reason I gave it 4stars) is because it tends to dry out temporarily which makes it difficult and frustrating to apply, and the product tends to dry and build up near the base of the applicator. Store it tip down to prevent this from happening, and clean the applicator every so often.…read more"

It always applies great the first couple times of using it but then starts too dry out way too quickly.

It did come off easily with make-up remover however, which was great.\nAnother plus: it creates a smooth line (as thin or as thick as you'd like), even if you don't have a particularly steady hand (I don't). Definitely superior to any other liquid or \"pen\" eyeliner I've ever tried. It's actually become my go-to formula for everyday and I just ordered it in Maya as well.\n\nBottom line: easy to apply, passed the crying test with flying colors…read more"

The tip allows very detailed and preciese lines, its very easy to make a subtle thin line or even a cat eye. I previously purchased Stila's stay all day water proof liner but it kept feathering and it was too glossy. This i'm glad to say goes on more matte. It last too. I wore it on a hot humid new york day were I was helping host a gathering and this did not budge not one bit.\n*One note I have to say, this went on VERY sheer when I first bought it, it almost looked gray. Ladies just swipe it a few times on your hand to get the ink/pigment flowing. I saw a few reviews that say this wasnt pigmented but it really is, just remember to swipe it a few times when you first purchase it so the liquid comes down.

It's only useful now for adding a small defined minuscule cat eye flick at the end but that would be just adding one more unnecessary step in my makeup routine and too expensive to buy again for just that purpose.

The color isn't very dark or pigmented, even if I swatch it on my hand as apposed to my eye, and it comes out very patchy. I often have to stop halfway through a line to shake the product in hopes that more will come out. Being that the product applies very patchy it also does not create precise lines at all. Finally, if I decide I'm going to go over an area again to darken it up it acts like an expo marker, removing any product that is already on the lid.

The brush tip is neither too soft nor too hard and makes application easy-peasy. And even if I mess up a bit, it's so thin, I can easily correct it that my final line is straight, yet not too thick.

I will try every eyeliner I can get my hands on, but I am also a ... spazz when it comes to applying it. The pen tip on this makes it so much easier for me to not end up with thick, squiglie eyeliner lines. That makes me really happy.\nThe color is decently dark, without being stark, and it's pretty matte so you're not focusing on a strange textured eyeliner line. (UD's 24/7 liquid liner and your weird pearly finish, I'm looking at you here).\nI've used this travel size almost everyday for seven months now. I'm starting to see some fraying on the brush tip, though I could have just put the cap on wrong (most likely case, to be honest). The tiny bit of fraying has not changed the application for me so far so I am not worried.\nI keep expecting this to run out of liner since it's a travel size, but it just keeps going which gives me high hopes for when I put the full size in my next Sephora order.\nThe liner lasts all day really well, though I do always use it over a primer so I don't know how well it lasts on it's own. (I don't imagine it having issues though.)\nAlso, the lines this makes are nice and sharp. The only thing I have found that makes sharper lines is UD's 24/7 liquid liner which is my other go-to liner. This tattoo liner is really perfect for making the wings on cat eyes though. I love it.\nI haven't tested if this is waterproof or not, I do have to continuously go over it with my makeup wipes to remove it so I would say that's likely.\nThis is not a smudgeable liner.

You can get a really deep, dark line with a clean edge.\n\nIt's also no joke when it comes to staying power. I've put it on, gone out and danced my rear off all night, fell asleep and it was still perfect the next morning. Or, let's be honest here, the next afternoon.\n\nBut just because it's great and long lasting doesn't mean you have to tear your eyelids off to get rid of it either. A little bit off eye makeup remover does the trick.\n\nFinally, the price. I'm all about getting the most for my money and you definitely do with this liner. At $18 it's a steal because it lasted me a good 6 months and I wear it at least 4 times a week, probably more.\n\nThe Kat Von D Tattoo Liner is hands down the best liquid eye liner I have ever used and I will be absolutely heartbroken if this ever gets discontinued.…read more"

         "description":"I've been using this eyeliner now for probably close to 2 years. Maybe longer. I am so madly in love with this product. I suffer from dry eye, and while no make-up will ever beat the battle of the tears, Kat Von D's eyeliner comes close. There is so much to love about this eyeliner. #1. The formula is well made. The liner stays on my eyes until I take it off and it comes off easily with make-up remover or cleansing oil. #2. The brush tip. I used to use Stila's eyeliner pen but constantly found the felt tip to be a massive drawback. The brush tip on Kat's eyeliner is perfection. It is made of tons of small hairs that never...and I mean never...get misshapen or dull. This is a godsend for those like me who rock cat eyes on a daily basis. #3. The product last FOREVER. I typically have each pen for 6 months or more and that's with daily use. Strong pigmentation and a serious bang for your buck. I've honestly never bought a product that was such an amazing return on investment. The price almost seems too low for how much product you actually get and with how well made the material attributes of the tube are. #4. Dries quickly. Unlike liquid eyeliner, you don't have to wait to open your eye for fear of smearing the liner into your crease. This stuff is like superglue. Set it and forget it...wait...that's the rotisserie machine... Anyways, as I was saying, this stuff dries quickly making it easier to finish up your make-up without fear of smudging. If you do make a mistake, it's easy to clean up with some make-up remover and a Q-Tip (I recommend Make Up Forever's sensitive eye remover. It's blue and so kind to your eyes. God bless it.)\n\nOh yeah, and it's waterproof. Like, legitimately waterproof. I have gone swimming and sweated and it hasn't budged.\n\nI know this was long winded but I really wanted to prove to you how quality this product is. I wouldn't write such a long review if I didn't have so much love for this product. I recommend it to everyone.…read more"

Not optimal, but it still looked almost completely flawless.\n- Pretty good black. I usually do 2 coats, which isn't too difficult to apply. It also dries fairly quickly, so you can do 2 coats very fast.\n- Long pen makes it easy to grip, and the learning curve is less steep than other liquid liners.\n- Appears to last a long time. Mine has lasted a couple months of almost daily usage, and is just now starting to show signs of running out.\n- Price/Value ratio. It appears to function for almost 3 months under daily use, with varying thicknesses of line. That kind of makes it worth the $18, and the easy-to-use pen.\n\nCons:\n- Pen dries out quickly. This was an issue at the beginning more, when it took me longer to apply my makeup.

I apply my makeup around 6am every morning and by 11 that night when I get ready for bed, the eyeliner looks the exact same! today I did yard work & washed my dogs outside in the muggy Florida weather, took a nap & woke up to find that my eyeliner looks the same as when I applied it.

But the brush tip is easy to maneuver, sort of like the felt tip ones I've used in the past. I draw the wing first, then start from the inside and trace along my eyelid. I dont even drag it, i just lightly press it, pick it up, and continue pressing until I reach the wing. The color is that great.\r\n\r\nPLUS I've worn it all day, gone out at night, danced at a sweaty bar, gone to sleep (I know, I know) and woken up with my eyeliner STILL ON POINT. i dont know a single drugstore liner that can do that without flaking off or smearing.\r\n\r\nah-mazing…read more"

I decided to go ahead and buy this liner and I am really impressed. It actually stays on all day and doesn't smudge at all. It dries really quickly for me. I'm still getting use to the tip, but I think I'll get a hang of it soon. I got the darkest shade and it looks great. I personally would prefer it being even darker.

Some may say the brown is to dark however I prefer not having bold black. Stays on all day. Glides on smoothly and thin which makes it easy to keep my lines straight! I've had my current full size one for 2 months and it's still going strong."

I have tried A LOT of liquid liners and this, by far, blows them all out of the water. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't smudge at all, it's a deep-deep black- so I don't need to apply multiple coats, and it applies like a dream. The tip is like a cross between a fine paintbrush and a marker, it's got that paint-brush shape, it's firm like a pen tip, and the end has just enough bend and flex that it moves well on the delicate skin around your eyes. \r\n\r\nIt also LASTS, I can put this on in the morning and it's not going anywhere all day. I have pretty oily skin, so by the end of the night (read: 12 hours later) it will smudge a bit if I rub it, but otherwise- it's set for the entire day. Don't have to worry about accidentally rubbing your eye and ruining your makeup. Despite that, it comes off w/ a basic makeup wipe without having to scrub your retinas apart. I cannot say enough good things about this liner, I love it and god help me if she ever gets rid of it!…read more"

I know that liquid eyeliners don't last forever but I don't think I should have to be repurchasing it after only two months! This is my only complaint, in terms of application and staying power it is great."

The marker-like tip is genius -- you could honestly draw a mural on your face with it. I was skeptical at first of the whole Kat Von D line; I thought it was maybe just gimicky.

I love the pigmentation and everything, I tried it on the top of my hand first to see what it looked like and it looked amazing. As soon as I try it on my eyelid it felt as if the felt tip already dried out instantly. Barely anything would come out of it. I'm very sad because I love how it looks on other people. I watched first impressions of it on YouTube and it seemed like it was worth the money. Reading some reviews here I notice that I'm not the only one who's having this problem. I still have my receipt and I might (if I can) return it to switch it with another one.\nObviously I'll be still trying it during the week to see if there's any changes, I have high hopes.…read more"

I tried and tried and tried but no eyeliner could truly make the line as thin as I wanted it... until tattoo liner. Oh my gosh. You can get so much precision with this tip. I would draw it on so you COULD NOT EVEN SEE THE LINE! And it would still be super pigmented AND stay for the whole day. Over the years I've continued to use it, and no matter how thick or thin or sharp or whatever my liner is, Tattoo Liner always comes through. Actually incredible. The only thing is, if you use liquid liner 24/7, this product runs out kind of quickly.

I don't like dramatic eyes for work and because the tip is so this I was able to make the lines super thin without skipping like I get from pencils. I also have oily lids which is why I gave up on pencils. I've tried Makeup Forever and Stila pencils and I had raccoon eyes after two hours. With this, after a whole day (7hrs) outside in the heat and humidity, the liner never budged (even though my face was an oily mess). I was disappointed that the brown was discontinued so I decided to experiment with a drugstore liquid liner (Loreal Telescopic Precision waterproof liquid) and it was so thick and goopy and flaked off like mascara after a few hours. I didn't even go outside! So although, I still might be annoyed about the lack of brown, I'll be buying a full size of the Tattoo Liner. I'm sold and don't want to experiment any more!…read more"

I'm unsure if it has to do with how it's stored. I've found that storing tip down (like artist brush pens) helps keep the felt tip pen supple with liquid. Once you finally get this to work properly and dispense enough liquid, it works wonders. At times it will dry out despite pumping into the pen and I will only use it for a faint wing outline that I fill in with another brand's liquid liner.…read more"

Also that it lasts longer since the brush doesn't get gunked up like felt tips with the product that's underneath making them chunky and uneven and just hard to work with. I do find that if I'm wearing a really chunky, glittery shadow underneath when I apply the liner then due to the consistency of it, it can mix in with the pigment and not look quite opaque enough on the first stroke. However if I just wait about 3 seconds and let the first coat dry and just go over it a second time then that problem is fixed! I am a liner junkie and I love this one.

It's a tad expensive ($18) and when I ran out, I decided to try a more affordable option and bought Sephora's Doe Eyed Felt Eyeliner ($12). Sephora's was all right, but it didn't go on quite as smoothly or easily as Kat's. I felt like it was more difficult to create the exact line I wanted than it was with Kat's. I used it for a little while, but decided it wasn't quite cutting it for me.\n\nI decided to return the Sephora brand eyeliner and get Kat's again, and once I started using it again I couldn't believe I ever left it! It was like I had gotten an old friend back, lol. Which is why I'm writing this review now. I discovered that the big difference is the brush. Most liner pens (like the Sephora one I tried) are a solid felt tip - Kat's is the only one with an actual BRUSH, which creates an infinitely more precise application. It allows you to easily create any thickness of line you want. I cannot recommend this product enough.

Sometimes it doesn't come out dark enough when I gently use just the tip but going over the same spot again but otherwise the precision is something to rave about. You can get as close to the lash line as possible and create any look, I think a cat-eye is super easy now with this. It is easy to use and it takes me half as long to do my eyeliner now. Highly recommend!"

I ordered this on 11/13; arrived and started using 11/16 - regularly 5 to 6 times a week. To my dismay yesterday, it is already dry (1/13- exactly 2 months from purchase date.\nThe ironic thing is though, the sample size that I used for 2.5 months before is still going strong. I don't know if maybe mine is faulty, but I am definitely surprised- and quite disappointed.\nFor those looking for a longer-lasting alternative, Clio eyeliners are extremely similar (same brush tip, slightly different formula) for approximately $5-10 cheaper. I have been using mine semi-regularly for approx 2 years now, and only now is it starting to lose color (but not dry!)…read more"

I don't know if it's because I have oily skin that it faded away so fast (almost like it had washed away) or because of something else. I figured I'd give it another chance, this time using primer so I wouldn't get oily, and still the wing faded away and it looked smudged despite me not touching it. Gave it one more chance because it's a $20 eyeliner and still it looked terrible after a few hours. I need long wear, smudge proof eyeliner and I've gotten better out of drugstore eyeliner.

Maybe I've just been spoiled by Marc, but I got used to how BLACK that liner is, and after using that for so long, I was really disappointed I couldn't get this liner as dark.

         "description":"Over the last 15 years, I have owned many eyeliners. To be honest, none compare to this one. I initially bought this one in the color \"trooper\" (simple black) at Sephora. My usual method of shopping for eyeliners is as follows: I walk throughout the store for 1/2 hour, during which time I draw on my hand with the prospective liners. I give them at least 1-2 minutes to set. Then I try the following:\n1. Smudge test: Results-->did not even budge.\n2. Saliva test: you can guess how this works. Results-->color remains bright, no smudging after 3 minutes.\n3. Time test: I try to wipe the eyeliner off my hand after 20 minutes of hard-core shopping for other cosmetics. Results-->still strong. If anything, stronger: stays on the skin throughout vigorous smudging attempts, as well as digestive enzyme applications (you guessed it, the saliva test repeated once again).\n4. Makeup remover test: this is what convinced me to buy this one. Results-->stays put for 4-5 serious wipes with the makeup remover, then eventually comes off. After wearing this eyeliner for the last several months, I have discovered that it easily lasts throughout the day (even throughout the length of my workday, which is basically 7AM - 6PM). I withstands my eyes tearing up, hot weather (hot Texas summers) and humidity.\n\nSidenote: This eyeliner is for those who want precision. It has a very fine tip, which allows for superior precision with regard to drawing extremely fine lines (something I absolutely love, but which is not for everyone).\n\nWhile I strongly value the worth of an eyeliner based on its ability to last throughout the day, this eyeliner not only delivers in function, but also in fun. Using this Kat von D eyeliner, it is possible to create an endless array of looks, ranging from the everyday (the one you put on in the morning without thinking) to the dramatic (the one you want to show off in the club). So rest assured, while you are experimenting with your look, your creation will stay put throughout the night...as well as the next morning.…read more"

         "description":"I love the brush tip - it's possibly one of the most precise applications for a liquid liner I've ever tried. It doesn't feel stiff, but it doesn't bend and mess up your line. Also, this liner doesn't cake on itself and wipe itself off. I mean that usually when I apply liquid liner, even when I wait for it to dry, sometimes the fine crease along my lash line will \"crack\" the liner - but this liner doesn't do that. Also, if you go over the same line more than once, it doesn't build on itself and wipe itself off, if that makes sense.\n\nMy only complaint is the intensity of the pigment. I have very black eyelashes, so I need the blackest and most intense possible color in order for liquid liner to look dramatic on my eyes. I wish I could take the color intensity of Stila's liquid liner and put it inside this Kat Von D liner. As the liner wasn't dark enough, I ended up returning it.\n\nI tried the waterproof version of this liner on my hand at the store, and it's a wonderful dark color, but it's shiny and reflective, which also reduces the intensity too much for me. Still on a search for the perfect liquid liner."

First off I wear it under a primer. I use the Mac primer under their paint pot section. I have never found a better primer to date. Also when storing this product if you store it upside down 1. The product lasts a lot longer and 2. You don't get the dry out from one eye to the next that some complain about. If you find that when you get to close to the year duct it's smudging into the eye or around that means you are getting to close and you may have over active tear ducks cause let me tell you this stuff\nDoesn't smudge. Unless of course you soak your whole face with water and rub it. Then yes. Hope people find this helpful."

Not that it doesn't EVER happen... Whatever, I don't know your life so I don't judge. :)\n\nYou'll have to go over your liner if you're putting it on top of a shiny eye shadow - the pigment doesn't stay true otherwise.

I love that it's waterproof because I do have oily eyelids and even through the primer and the concealer, regular eyeliner still tends to smudge along my crease but this one stays true! I would definitely make this a staple."

The fine tip is its best feature, as it helps you draw the most precise lines ever. In the winter time, it does stay on forever but I get smudged creases in the summer when it gets hot and humid. If you go over the line too many times, you also end up rubbing several spots off. It also runs out pretty quickly for its price, and it's too bad it's not waterproof either. It would be the perfect eyeliner if they would just update the formula with stronger staying power, made it waterproof, and have it come with more ink to make the price worthwhile.",

I drew precise, delicate lines with barely any effort. I easily built up to thicker lines when I felt like it.\n\n2) Fast-drying: Though it's good to wait a couple seconds before blinking.\n\n3) Long-lasting: Hours later, my eyeliner was right where it started...and it looked great!\n\nI'm very happy with this liner and will buy more when it runs out :)"

It continues to do it todayslowing down my make-up application, stopping to do circles on my hand to get it started again, and then I have to clean off my hand with make-up remover. Just an annoyance. But other than that I like the liner once it's on, and it certainly does stay in place!

I tried brushing it on the back of my hand a couple times and shaking it to bring up some more product into the brush area but when I continued it just wouldn't come out. I stopped using it and only use it occasionally. It's very attracted to shadows.

I love that it's a brush tip and not a felt tip so it will never fray, and the bristles feel so nice on my eyelids. The product is quite pigmented. You do have to shake it before you use it and the only things that bother me a bit are that sometimes the ink stops flowing and I have to swatch it on my hand a few times to get it going again and if you go over a line too much, the product kind of pulls itself up. The trick with this is just to work quickly so you don't have to drag over the dried liner too much. Overall, though, I'm just very glad I bought this one because of its applicator and its really black pigmentation. It's not 100% matte but its so black, you can't really tell. Lasts all day (unless you rub your eyes, which I don't do when I'm wearing makeup). I'd definitely repurchase this product."

Easy to control. Doesn't snag or skip over the squinty lumps in my outer corners when I do my cat eye. And, I can do a super thin line in the inner corner of my eye and gradually thicken it to create a nice precise line. Also stays put all day, no exceptions. Only thing to watch for if you have the same liner ‘wants’ as me: it's not really black enough and find product runs out quickly – I like a thick line but can never work the thicker tipped liners with finess. When it dries up I can coax out more colour for a while if I moisten the pen on my tongue (who knows if there are some wacky side effects from that down the line ha ha ha). Yup, living on the edge for my perfect cat eye! So basically this pen is great for those like me who struggle to get that perfect line. My work-around to conserve the fluid is to use this pen to create a cat eye 'outline' then fill it in with another liner."

This is the first eyeliner that literally stays put all day, where even the sharpest point is unsmudged. The brush is also amazing too. Felt tipped eyeliners that I've used in the past kept fraying up and erasing my lines as I tried to make the lines thicker and they were never truly black. This brush glides effortlessly and is actually truly black. Using an eyelash curler after I used to apply eyeliner always took the eyeliner with it when I put it against my eye. This is a problem no longer. It really does not budge. Even on long days outside where I'm sweating, this eyeliner stays put. The best part is that while it doesn't move, it comes off easily when it's time to take my makeup off. Kat has seriously perfected liquid eyeliner and I'm so glad that I've found my HG."

My only complaint is that is dries up fairly quickly. Only after a short number of times using the product it starts to dry up. I have to keep several of them cap down in my jar so that when the liner stops working I can switch to another pen while that one is \"reinking\". When the pens are new they work amazing. Its only after Ive used them a while that they start to dry up. Also, you can't tell when you're getting low.\nSo, I'd suggest getting a few of these.

I bought into the hype and I was excited - it was really black, matte, and gave me the perfect wing every time. But unfortunately, after using it for a few weeks it started to apply much fainter (not enough ink) and after two months of using it about 4x a week and never leaving the cap off when not in use, it has dried out completely. When I say completely, I mean completely. I tried standing it up for a few days without opening it.. shaking it up.. everything, but no go. At $19 I won't be purchasing it again, that's just too much (for me) to justify having to replace it every 2 months - there are so many cheaper alternatives I've loved in the past, some as low as $2 that lasted much longer. Also, the tip did not stay intact, it has kind of flared out so it does not give a precise line anymore (if it were to work, that is). Maybe I just got a faulty one, but I guess I won't be finding out."

         "description":"Creating a winged eyeliner look is often time consuming and difficult until you really get the hang of it, but even then, most of those flimsy brush applicator tips have minds of their own and tend to make the process quite a hassle. I love a nice dramatic cat eye, but I would often stray away from creating the look unless I had ample time. That was the case until i decided to purchase Kat's Tattoo Liner. The applicator tip is stiff enough to give control, but supple enough to glide and curve smoothly for a seamless application. The pigment is build-able, so in the rare moments that the formula comes out a bit light, I give it a second to dry and go over the spot again to make it opaque. Another awesome aspect of the applicator is that the tip goes to a fine, tapered point, so you can angle it to create either a thick line or a fine point for a cat eye!"

I can confidently say that the product in the Kat Von D pen will last 2-3 times longer than the Stila liner.\n3. Much easier to wash off compared to the Stila liner (with makeup remover). Don't worry, this won't budge with just water.\n4. Only con I can think of is the Stila liner is slightly more matte than the Kat Von D liner.\n\nJust try it, you will see what I mean :)"

My only complaint is that the very tip of the pen does dry out towards the end, but you can make it work until it's all used up. HANDS DOWN ONLY BLACK LIQUID LINER THAT I WILL EVER USE"

         "description":"Eyeliner can be a hassle, whether it is for work, school, or a night out. However, Kat Von D’s Tattoo Liner in Trooper is perfect for regular use especially if you are constantly busy, and need something long lasting that will not be harsh on your eyes.\n\nThe pen itself has a soft, narrow brush that is perfect for creating thin, buildable lines. Many liners with similar brushes dry out extremely fast, but not Trooper. My liner has lasted me months, and I will definitely repurchase it when the formula does run out.\n\nThe formula is so long lasting. You could put this on at 6 am before work or school, and it would last you all day. And if you want to go out with friends or family afterwards and want a more dramatic look Trooper builds beautifully. You won’t have to worry about the liner from flaking off as you thicken your look.\n\nAnd if you’re nervous about applying liquid linear, don’t be; Trooper can be used by beginners and pros. For only $19 dollars, Trooper is an affordable high end product that creates great looks with ease due to its high pigmentation, and precise applicator. Plus it dries instantaneously; it won’t ever smudge like an ordinary pencil liner or drip into your eyes.\n\nDespite Trooper’s staying power, it is so simple to remove. No need to rub your eyes raw with harsh make up remover. Trooper comes off with a simple wipe of micellar water and a cotton pad.\n\nHope you enjoy it and much as I have!"

         "description":"I use a liquid liner to tightline at the base of my upper lashes but I have to be careful about the product I use, as some don't play well with contacts. This one doesn't work for me. After about 20 minutes post-application it starts seeping into my eyes and coats my contacts with a haze, so that about an hour in my vision is so blurred I'm nearly blind. The upside is that I could wash it off my contacts (other formulas stick like glue and there's no getting it off) so I didn't ruin 3 pairs of contacts over the 3 days I was testing it. I used it like a standard liner to get a bit of a wing effect and it was great for that, as far as ease of use. It's more of a dark grey than a true black, which in some ways makes it more foolproof - and it doesn't gush out of the pen like some formulas, which makes it easier to control. It is more precise than a lot of liquid liners I've used. So props for easy application - it just didn't work for me and I wouldn't recommend it to others who wear contacts."
