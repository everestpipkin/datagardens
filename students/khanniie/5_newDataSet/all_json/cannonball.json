         "description":"I usually never take the time to write reviews, but definitely felt I had to for this mascara! I have tried countless brands of mascara searching for one that did it all for me - I wanted length, volume, and curl (something that seems impossible for me to get or last throughout the day). After reading the reviews on this mascara I was so excited to try it! In my opinion it is one of the best mascaras I've tried! The formula is perfect, not too wet like some can be, but not dry either... Cannonball's formula makes application very easy and with a couple swipes my eyelashes looked the best I've ever seen them look! Even my husband noticed at dinner - he asked me if I used a different mascara and then asked if I applied false lashes too... that's much of a difference this mascara made for me. The curl has been going strong for 5 hours now and usually my lashes hold no curl. I notice no flaking or smudging either. I know products work differently for everyone, but for me this seems to be the formula I've been looking to find for quite some time now! 5 stars in my book! I posted a pic of my eyes to show the difference before/after!\n…read more"

         "description":"I have every waterproof mascara there is and am not happy with the lot of them (mostly high-end). This Cannonball is truly better than sex. I have an old-fashioned idea of how lashes should look - I want them separated, not clumpy without fibers going every which way. I don't need length and I want my lashes to stay curled when I apply the mascara after I use my eyelash curler. THIS MASCARA WINS 5 STARS FOR EVERY BOX ON MY LIST. It has stayed on all day - no flaking or smudging and my eyelashes look fabulous - just like they did 10 hours ago. This is now my Holy Grail and I'm going to purchase a couple of backups.\n…read more"

         "description":"I am a lifelong waterproof mascara devotee. I'm always looking for a better WP mascara. Cannonball can hold it's own along with the best. 1) It glides on like a dream. No clumping 2) It holds my curl... something only the best WP formulas can manage 3) Transforms my short stumpy lashes into long lashes (my expectations are realistic, no mascara is going to make my lashes \"advertisement long\") 4) Is water-resistant, and to a degree, waterproof. Here's the thing. The effectiveness wanes after about 6 hours. At that point, the lashes dull down a bit... although I don't see any smudging or flecks of mascara wandering. The mascara just does not look as fresh as when first applied. And when splashed with water, the lashes wilt ... but when splashed with water one hour after application, lashes are fine. 6) Color is black, but could be a richer deeper black. All in all, I would give this 4.5stars. Half a point off for fading after six hours. But I will buy again.. it's a great mascara.\n…read more"

That said, it is really hard to remove. You HAVE to use something oil-based to take it off. As far as how it looks - it is beautiful. I have long lashes naturally, and this thickens, lengthens, and most of all CURLS. It curls my lashes like nothing ever has - not even a lash curler. Pretty amazing. It's also a very deep black, and doesn't even feel like you're wearing mascara. It's very lightweight. LOVE.\n…read more"

First of all, this is a ULTRA WATERPROOF mascara, so if you don't like waterproof, you prob. don't want to use this. But for all the girls out there who love waterproof, and have limpy, non-curling lame lashes, this is your life saver. From the reviews I read, I didn't think this was going to help much with volume and length, but I was wrong. 1. It'll lift and curl and hold 2. it'll separate and volumize lashes 3. it'll stay on without flaking 4. my lashes are surprisingly still very soft, not hard and flaky! 5. I love the small brush that gets all of your eyelashes and really lift and define. If there is an under rated product out there, this is it. Try it now!!!! Definitely going to be a staple in my collection.\n…read more"

Urban Decay has created the impossible: a seriously lengthening, volumizing, uber-waterproof, smudge proof mascara!! I am a personal trainer and spin instructor- sweat pours down my face during classes and long outdoor runs. Nonetheless, this mascara stays intact: no racoon eyes, no smudges, no dry eyes (I wear contacts) or caked lashes. If only they made a waterproof eyeliner as stealthy!! I am a die hard fan of the length, volume, and wear I get from Benefit's Bad Gal Lash, but the waterproof version doesn't live up to its name, so I have found a beyond worthy replacement!

I am Asian and have short, thin lashes on monolid eyes. It is extremely difficult to find a mascara that's able to hold up a curl under the weight of my eyelid. This mascara hoewever, has been able to defy gravity! I match it with my Shu Uemura eye lash curler before applying. After applying Cannonball however, I also add a thickening mascara to the tips of my lashes to make them pop more since this is purely for lengthening/waterproof and gives -->NO THICKENING<-- at all. Overall, if you have thin, short lashes like me, I would definitely make the investment. It is pricey, but it's still less expensive than other high end mascaras.\n…read more"

         "description":"I am so glad i decided to get this mascara. UD you've outdone yourself. girls this mascara ..is AMAZING.. 1) holds curl instantly - the dry formula holds lashes exactly how they are curled all day and doesn't flake. apply this where your lashes are curled near the base for extra lift 2) extremely water proof - i live in Toronto so snow and wind usually mean runny mascara. definitely not the case with this. i wear this allllll over my lower lashes and not a smudge all day!! bye bye raccoon eyes. its even a little hard to take off. i need to invest in a better makeup remover! 3)fibers add volume and length - the fibers are quite fine so you don't really see them but they are working. adding additional layers will add volume with no added weight. 4) separates lashes - the brush is small compared to others and has short bristles so i was quite skeptical about its separating abilities but i was proven wrong. really wiggle the brush around horizontally to get the little bristles between the lashes the one thing about this mascara, is that its not as dark as i'd like it to be. So for those days you want that added drama in your eyes and big black lashes, this may not be your go to. its still very black, but not Dior Blackout black. the mascara didn't do so good with layering with other mascaras. Ii tried to layer this over Buxom lash mascara which is great at separating, to make it waterproof and hold curl. it didn't really work out, just kind of weighed my lashes down. it may work with another base mascara. i have short asian lashes so the length and curl it adds as you can see in the pic is a big deal. my camera phone kinda sucks, its not doing the mascara justice! overall this is the best mascara I've tried, and I've tried a TON for my short stiff lashes. excuse the essay but really, i cant say enough good things about cannonball!

The waterproof aspect is okay. I've tested it out swimming a few times and it stays on (though you lose some curl, obviously). Since it has fibers, it can flake a little.

         "description":"When I first wrote a review on UD's new Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara, I was pretty happy with it. I still am. I like how it coats, doesn't clump, and defines. In hot weather, we spend time on a boat. It gets windy sometimes and the water sometimes splashes in my eyes, causing other mascara to smudge a little. That doesn't happen with Cannonball. Because I find the wind to be drying to my eyes, on days that it's windy, I had been putting liquid lubricating drops in my eyes as a preventative. Those drops caused most waterproof mascara to run or smudge anywhere from a little to a lot, depending on the brand. I'm really impressed at how Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara wasn't bothered by the liquid drops. The one thing I do notice is that while this defines and coats really well, it's not adding too much volume to my long thick lashes like my regular mascara does, and I don't seem to see any lengthening either. I'm impressed at how well it defines my lashes, and stays in place until I remove it so I'm going to use it every time I'm for outdoor water activities. It doesn't disappoint.\n…read more"

Pros: Super waterproof Fibers add length (but flakes off during wear) Smudge-proof (with primer) Cons: Formula degrades over time fairly quickly (within 2 months) Does not keep lash curl after formula degrades By the end of my 3 month stint with this tube, it'd look fantastic on for the first 10 minutes, and 2 hours later I find my lashes have lost most of its curl and drooped back down. I only apply mascara at the base of my lashes during the day, so I know it's not because it's weighing my lashes down.

One the \"pro\" side, this mascara is truly ULTRA waterproof, it stays put through swimming, sweating, anything. I live in southern Italy where it is hot and balmy all summer and this mascara is my staple. On the \"con\", very annoying side; this mascara is filled with tiny hair-like fibers that flake off into your eyes though the day. This is especially problematic when you are sweating these fibers into your eyes at the gym forcing you to interrupt your routine to get the hairs out of your eye. What a pain! The mascara itself will stay put through anything, but those fibers have got to go. I have been on the search for another waterproof mascara that works as well as this, to no avail. So I will probably suck it up with the fibers and continue to have beautiful lashes with Cannonball through this next sweaty Italian summer.\n…read more"

I live in Florida after all and have yet to meet a mascara than can withstand sweat, allergies, sudden downpours, and last minute dives in the pool. Until this mascara. As some of the less positive reviews point out this mascara doesn't do much in terms of lengthening or creating voluminous lashes, but I've never come across a mascara that can withstand Florida so well. Not only does it hold up under pressure, it also comes off relatively easily with a remover. I've used waterproof mascaras that have smeared all over the place then refused to come off.

Enough to give your eyes a little something extra special without making people at the office wonder why you're going full on glam. I have pretty straight lashes. Curling them and giving a couple of swipes of this mascara to my lashes is pretty great for every day. It is a bit of a pain to get off, yet I feel like i can't complain because it's staying power is precisely what I love about it.

I have decided this is AMAZING mascara. The best part, to me, is the lightness of the formula. So many mascaras weigh down lashes. My lashes stay curled with this. The stay is good, I don't find it smears. I'm not sure it would hold up in the pool, I will find out soon, but I'm not that concerned about that. I find it lengthens and defines nicely. I don't think one coat does much for volumizing, but I have thick lashes so that is fine with me. If volumizing is important to you, I don't think this is the right mascara.

It gives great separation, great length, and with proper eye-lining it even has great volume. The formula is good, and the brush is as well. The brush is more on the stiffer side, so if you hate the plastic ones due to how it feels, you may not like this. The brush is small so it can get every lash without causing you to look like you have a black eye. It rinses off easily with eye make up remover (I use target brand). Overall I am super shocked at how good this is because I haven't ever tried UD mascaras due to reputation. Yes, it's $20, but it's very well spent.

It is pretty waterproof and stays all day. However it does flake here and there but for me this isn't really a problem. It is more difficult to take off because of the waterproof formula. The brush is pretty small so you can create definition and it is pretty good for layering. After a while of use it dries and clumps a little in the bottle but by then it's time to buy a new one anyways. The main thing I want to emphasis is that IT KEEPS A CURL. That is so hard for me to find in a mascara. The color is deep black. I haven't had a problem with smearing, like if you were to work out and sweat in it.

However, it does smudge a bit for me since I have oily eyelids, and if I don't try very hard to wipe off most of the product for the first coat, my lashes can become clumpy and spidery, and I have to use a comb to brush through. All in all I recommend highly!! But please ladies wipe the excess off before applying and you will have amazing fluttery lashes.\n…read more"

So, I tested my luck with the Urban Decay Cannonball and I must say I am IMPRESSED! I went swimming in both pools with chlorine, AND salty oceans, and when I looked in the mirror, it didn't even budge! It was intriguing. Even when I was tanning in the hot sun, it didn't even melt off my face like most \"waterproof\" mascaras do. This mascara holds true to length, but not so much to volume. I only ever really needed length,so the lack of volume didn't bother me much.. what more is there to ask for? This isn't a mascara that I'm going to buy every time, but in the summer, the Cannonball is a MUST ladies! Or when you're going vacationing to the tropics! (This picture is after I went swimming for hours in both pools and the ocean, and it didn't even smear or budge!

They're the only one mascaras that will hold my short ad straight Asian lashes up all day. \r\n\r\nThis one holds my curl all day whilst giving length and nice separation. With only one coat, it gives somewhat a natural look. The second coat makes a huge difference compared to just putting one coat; it can make your lashes look voluminous, but not clumpy. \r\n\r\nSide note: because of the numerous bristles on the brush, it's really easy to separate the lashes if you wiggle the wand properly. If you're not careful, it can look clumpy because of the fibers (that also give you length).\r\n\r\nAs far as the waterproof aspect goes, it depends on my skin's state. The mascara itself is very waterproof and hard to remove unless you have an oil based make up remover. My skin can be an oil producing factory and on those days, I get minimal smudging.

However, this one seriously makes your lashes look nice, dark, thick, and long, but will ACTUALLY stay on through exercise, humid days, and even jumping into the pool! I have repurchased twice already. It's awesome. Not the most intense mascara ever, but will make your lashes look naturally gorgeous. Sometimes if I want a really dramatic look for going out or something I layer it over my other fave mascara (Lancome's Hypnose Drama) to increase it's staying power and liklihood of smudging, which works pretty well!! For people that are complaining about it being clumpy - clean your brush off! And for people that have flaking into their eyes, I have only had this happen when I have layered more mascara on after it had fully dried. If I continue to build it up while it is still a little wet this doesn't seem to happen for me. Also, if you do fully jump in the pool I would NOT recommend like rubbing your eyes a lot... that will definitely lead to some smudging/clumping. But it will definitely not melt off from the water alone!!\n…read more"

I work all day outside running after kids and swim a LOT and every \"waterproof\" mascara I have ever tried leaves ugly black smudges under my eyes. After reading a bunch a great reviews I tried this one. It gave me volume, length, the wand is great for getting clumps out, hold my curl, AND DID NOT BUDGE ALL DAY. Amazing. I will say it's not the MOST volumizing or lengthening mascara ever, but it does a pretty good job. One thing I will say is because it's so waterproof you have to remove it with some cold cream (which is great for keeping your face young anyway) and let it sit on your lashes for at least 30 seconds and then gently massage the mascara off to avoid drying out and breaking lashes. I usually do this anyway to get my makeup off, but for those of you who don't, I highly recommend it. :)\n…read more"

The mascara is very defining, with subtle lift, but not any kind of major volume, which is why I start with the They're Real by Benefit and finish my coats with the Cannonball and they work out great together. It does have a lengthening quality to it,too. My eyelashes also don't feel dry, which is important. It's easy to remove with a make up removing cloth and it all comes off, no leftover residue.

Athough some of the fibers flake off and a little smudging is present at the end of my 12 hours it's a small price to pay. Most people who don't have oily lids will likely find smudging not a problem at all anyway. It's best to really make sure to remove all the excess product before applying as it tends to get clumpy when you apply too much, thus weighing down your lashes and cutting the life of your curl short. So apply thin layers using a light hand. I find this really makes my lashes look most natural and adds to the longevity of my curl.

I went swimming in the reefs around the island every day for a week and it didn't smudge or run into my eyes. It even survived several cannonballs off the boat. This is really well-suited to saltwater. At home, in Canada, I did find that it would leave tiny little fibers along my browbone (from the tips of my lashes). In the humidity of the Carribean, I didn't experience this problem at all. As a bonus, it stayed on my upper lashline/tightline all day which was a welcome surprise as I forgot to pack any eyeliner.

I kept hearing Jen from frmheadtotoe raving about this mascara for months and used it constantly in almost of her recent videos, so because of that I gave it a try. Yes I did hope this could be 'that mascara'! I just got it today in the mail and I instantly put it on without eyelash curler and eyelash primer. I just put it on by itself. So it curled my lashes and dried really fast! It doesn't thicken my lashes when I applied the first coat, but after 2 coats my lashes look fuller and longer. I would have to say that there are some micro-fibers in the formula & I guess it for the lengthening (and thickening?) purposes. So far I am in love & excited that UD Cannonball is able to give me the best results that no other mascara can. Though I haven't get a chance to test whether if it is really waterproof or not, but I will able to this Friday when I go to the pool at my university. In addition, it hasn't smudge on me all days so that is awesome!!\n…read more"

It also makes your lashes long and feathery, and the black is nice and glossy. It stays in place really well and doesn't even flake into my eyes when I forget to take it off at night. I have really sensitive eyes, and my eyes don't burn from this at all. All in all, this is a fantastic mascara. I'm a mascara junkie, but this is one I'll definitely buy again.

I bought their Naked Palette and their primer is genius, so how could they go wrong with mascara? Bound to be the answer to my lash-needs. Negative. I have very straight lashes. I need to curl them and then apply mascara, usually waterproof to ensure that the mascara won't give me \"raccoon eyes\" by the end of the day. I curled my lashes, applied the mascara and was happy with how they looked . . . for the first hour. Normally, waterproof mascaras hold curls better because of the formulation. By noon, the mascara was not holding the curl nor staying put. Please keep in mind I work indoors in an office that is kept at frigid temperatures in the summer, so it wasn't as if I were outside jumping in and out of a pool/ocean and playing volleyball, I was at work. Six hours after I had applied the mascara, it was clear that I had the \"raccoon eye effect\" going. It was embarrassing and it was so disheartening because I really thought this would be a great product. I am guessing if you have NATURALLY CURLY LASHES, this MAY be good, but if you have straight lashes, please save your money. DO NOT buy this product. It is not well formulated.\n…read more"

         "description":"After trying the waterproof versions of Diorshow (left horrible rings under my eyes just from walking around during the day, so can't imagine what would happen in H2O) and Phenomen'eyes (waterproof, but also gloppy, clumpy, left my lashes stuck together like spikes), I decided to give Cannonball a shot. And it's great! I feel like waterproof formulas are always a little sticker than regular mascara, but this lengthens and fans my lashes out beautifully and it definitely stays on all day without smudging, even on the most humid and sweaty of days. The only thing I don't love is the smell ... I'm not surprised it's waterproof, because it smells like you're coating your lashes in melted down vinyl pool floats and old tires. Blech. Once you close the tube the smell goes away, though, so I can deal. Overall it's definitely the best waterproof mascara I've tried so far.\n…read more"

It isn't a volumizing mascara, but it does add enough to make a big difference to lashes like mine and avoids the whole gross clumping/sticking issue. in turn, it also keeps the formula very flexible and natural-looking too, which I love. I do agree with some other reviews that this mascara is a bit pricey, but I've been paying approximately $20 for my old mascaras anyways. I live in Canada, and any in-store Asian mascaras in retail stores are marked up a lot (way more than they are worth), and ordering online also has the added cost of shipping which always brings the cost to about $15-$20.

Try keeping the number of coats to a max of 2-3, because that is when it starts to clump, although not too badly.

Unlike drugstore waterproof mascaras that tend to make my lashes look spidery, Cannonball makes them fuller, lusher and darker. I tend to layer this mascara with my Benefit \"They're Real!\" and I always get compliments on how my lashes look like they're fake."

Bummed, because it performs well in all other aspects, but the whole reason I bought it in the first place was to AVOID raccoon eyes. I may as well go back to my other mascara if this isn't going to be waterproof.\n…read more"

The formula is light & not clumpy so you can layer it on easily & get the desired look your after. It looked like I had fake lashes on by the time I was done layering it on for a heavy night look. First time I used it, I thought for sure it would a pain to get off because it stayed so well but it does come off easily with normal facial cleaner & hot water. But I would recommend using a waterproof eye make up remover so you dont have to tug & rub on your sensitive eye area. I tried it with the Dior las primer but it works a better with the Urban Decay lash primer.\n…read more"

However, like all strong waterproof formulas, it does clumps a little when unevenly applied or if you don't layer it up quickly enough. And sometime if you build up to much it would flake. I always brush it through and seperate everything with a clean lash comb, also to comb off any big chunks of fibre.

Cons: smudges every time I blink (bc my upper lashes make contact with my lower lid) To be fair, most mascaras smudge or flake on me. The mascara's that don't straighten out my curl (I have those pesky straight Asian lashes).
