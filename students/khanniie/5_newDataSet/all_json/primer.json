         "description":"I like the consistency of the product itself and how it helps the shadow powder stay putt during for hours. This is a great product. I have used other primers but UD is my favorite. I also like Sin which gives nice champagne shimmer.\n\nThe reason for two stars is the new supposedly improved container and the applicator. I absolutely do NOT like this change because the wand Is useless! I end up using my finger to apply the product anyway. Because of this wand, there seems to be less product in the tube and it is hard to use the last bit left in the tube. Please bring the old tube container!…read more"

         "title":"Excellent primer, BUT...",
         "description":"I've been using this primer for years... back from when it had the original hard tube and stick applicator packing. Back then, the primer was still the same excellent product that they have today, but I would have given it two stars just for the really awful packaging. It was impossible to get anything out, you had to take a hand saw to it (not kidding). Then came the squeeze tube packaging and it changed everything. I stored it upside-down (cap down) to make sure I got every last bit out. Now with the new packaging, you get the best of both worlds: people who like the applicator and people who like the squeeze tube both get what they want. I personally don't care for the applicator, I end up using my fingers to blend it anyway.\n\nBUT, as another reviewer said, this will turn gunky and disgusting if it comes in contact with your foundation. I have used foundations from NARS, UD, Hourglass, Lancome, MUF, liquids, creams, powders, tinted moisturisers... you name it, I've tried it. If there's ANY traces of foundation on your eyelids and it mixes with this primer, it will look like you spread glue stick on your lids and you won't be able to blend any eyeshadow. Your best bet is to do your eye makeup first and then do your face makeup, or just avoid putting foundation on your lids.\n\nAlso, with this new packaging, you're getting less product. With the squeeze tube you got 0.37oz. With this new one you only get 0.33oz. It's very slight, but still annoying and I saw someone else comment that there was more product in this newer version, which is simply not true. The new tube might LOOK bigger to accommodate the applicator inside, but it indeed has less product.\n\nOther than that, this product is great. I'm extremely oily (I use 3-4 blotting sheets every time I blot, and I blot at least 3-4 times a day) and I've never had any issues with eyeshadow not showing, creasing, or sliding off. I've never used any other brands though, so I can't compare.…read more"

However, the applicator being used on the lids just irks me because the tube/product goes bad after a while since the applicator contaminates the rest of the contents after a while.

I ran out and obviously went to buy a new tube..to my surprise, they changed it. It's now a wand instead of just squeezing it out of the tube. The wand seems cheaply made like it could snap in half and not enough product gets on the wand. And they changed the formula! It makes me even more oily! Not the same consistency. Very disappointed in the changes."

It always kept all eye make-up in place all day and even through the night without any touchups. It lasted from morning until I washed it off. Now for some reason it does not last more than a couple hours before it's oily, creased and really awful looking. Luckily the older packaging is marked down right now so I ordered it before it's completely gone! What happened??!! After my old packaging is out I will have to look for something else."

I'm shocked and disappointed, this used to be a staple in my make up collection but now I'm keeping an eye out for a new product. Oh and I realize it could just be a bad tube that I purchased but I've had girlfriends experience the same problem."

No creasing, no fading, makes my eyeshadows intensely colored on my lids and stunning. They last for over 24 hours if I sleep in makeup and forget to take it off. Like I mentioned 1 tube - almost 3 years. Still has enough left to finish out the rests of this year.\n\nNARS Smudge Proof Eye base also makes my eyeshadows not crease, buuuuuut it has 1/3 less product, and you can't squeeze every last drop out of the tube.....\n\nUrban Decay wins."

First of all, it's much easier to apply this product with your fingers in my opinion, so the new little wand they added is completely useless. Second, with the new packaging I've found that once you're getting a little low, you have to squeeze hard to get more out which can end up in a huge blob of it coming out. I've unintentionally wasted so much product when this happens which is really annoying. It's a shame because I'm now considering switching to a different brand even though I love the primer itself."

I did notice the size is slightly smaller than the regualr tube but I can accept that. The wand is a waste because you really need to rub it in with your fingers to apply it. The cream is now very oily and thinner. They must have changed the formulation or maybe the thicker part is staying at the bottom of the tube which you really cannot get out. What a shame. Such a terrific product and Urban Decay ruined it. The Marketing team better re-think this cost savings idea as you they will loose customers."

I decided to put a little of the primer under my eyes. I was shocked to see at the end of a long day, it didn't run! Wasn't sure if it was a fluke, so I tried one of my cheaper eye liners, it still barely moved!\nThank you Urban Decay for a duel purpose primer!"

I used the tube and bought the new primer with the applicator, and bought one for my sister as well. We both felt the applicator didn't blend well, we ended using our fingers to blend. We done that in the past with the tube, so not a big deal, thought maybe the applicator can be used to dig out more product. Nope, that didn't work!!! So the applicator is not useful to blend, and not able to take out more primer then it's not useful!!! It was no longer creamy to blend, more liquid than cream. I used it twice, and did not look as great as the original tube, eye shadows looked terrible. What happened, please bring back the tube!!!! My sister and I end up trying other brands!!!"

Everything eventually creases and separates on my lids, but THIS primer blew me away! \n\nI had been using the NARS primer which was not bad, held the oil at bay for 4 hours which was great for my eye shape. I tried the UD with a matte smoky eye, and it was seriously a dream come true!!\n\nUsing the appropriate shadow is just as important I believe. I know some didn't think the primer was doing the job, but keep in mind that using a mineral shadow on an oily lid is usually not likely to stay. Also, do ONE lid at a time. If you put primer on both lids, one will be completely dry by the time you get to it. I should not be wet, but a little bit tacky to lock in the powder.\n\nGreat product, Urban Decay is really winning me over."

I never really thought much of eyeshadow primer since I was fairly new to make up and didn't realize how important it was to actually making your eyeshadow last, but I was happy nonetheless because it was free product!\n\nThe first time I used it I was happy to see how long it lasted and decided that I would continue to use it in place of my ELF one since it blended better onto my brown skintone. I've been hooked ever since.\n\nI've somehow managed to make the sample sizes last until now and I still have a good amount of the original, matte and sin ones left. However, once I finally run out of the samples I'm going to have to book it to Sephora (or urbandecay.com if I'm feeling lazy) and buy it immediately.\n\nI can honestly say that if you're looking for a primer that will make your eyeshadow last, this is the one.

I still get smeared eye liner (even waterproof, smudge proof), and fading/creasing eye shadow.

When they say there is no creasing of eye makeup, they are not kidding around! I can spend five hours sweating in the summer sun at work and my makeup will not have budged. It definitely delivers on its promise to make eyeshadow colour more vibrant, and it leaves my skin feeling nice. However I just went out and bought a replacement since I'm out, and the new packaging's doe-foot applicator was broken when I took it out of the tube. It flops around like a sad marionette and I'm considering cutting it off to avoid getting it lost inside the bottle. I don't want to bother taking it back since I've read on a few blogs that it's a fairly common problem, and there's no guarantee the new bottle would be any different. Since the bottle squeezes I'm not as SOL as I would've been with the old genie bottle packaging, but it's still a disappointment, given how much it costs. Would've been better without the applicator at all, the squeeze bottle with a fine tip was much better. The formula, too, seems to be runnier than it used to be. It used to be like a spongy crème, and now it seems like a liquid, also a smaller volume of product for the same price than previous iterations. Urban Decay would have to do a lot of things really badly to lose my loyalty, but I would hate to think that they're starting down that path."

I finally decided to try this because I'm currently deployed and it's incredibly hot in the desert (go figure). I only wear eyeliner when I'm at work but I would notice that by the end of the day, I'd have 2 or 3 black half-moon rings on my eyelids because my eyeliner would crease. Today was my first time using it and after 9 hours in 105 degree heat, my eyelids are still matte, smooth, and oil-free! Zero shine!

I don't typically buy high-end makeup so I just resisted this product. I did buy cheaper versions of this: I've used Loreal's eye primer, as well as ELF.\nI must say there is absolutely no comparison. Urban Decay's product is an absolute essential for making eyeshadow look great and to ease in blending. There is a reason for the hype!\nI purchased the tube in the original formula (no color). The price was around twenty dollars plus tax. The packaging is nice, and the tube is pretty large. You do get a LOT of product for your money. I think if I were to really add it up mathematically, the cost per usage would be much better than any cheaper version.\nI had a big event to go to so I decided to purchase. I was doing some pretty dramatic eye makeup and wanted to use that as an opportunity to try this product out. I was blown away. Blending was easier, the colors of the makeup really 'popped' (I was wearing teal/turquoise eyeshadows with some gold). More importantly, the eyeshadow looked unbelievably fresh for the entire party (around 7 hours) and even when I was washing off the makeup later that night, there was not any sign that the eye makeup had been applied hours earlier.\nTruly a fantastic product.\nI will be buying this again and again. In fact, I will make sure to always have this in my makeup bag.\nHighly recommended!"

Something has changed.  I recently bought this again since my last tube ran out a long time ago and I had dice ventured to try other brands for an eye primer.  I was excited to get this again because I remember loving it so much before.  First off I don't like th wand applicator.  Or maybe it's the formula and the wand applicator combination but it doens't grab the product or disperse it evenly.  I have been forgoing the wand to squeeze the stuff out of the tube like toothpaste.  And maybe the formula has changed or maybe I've changed but this dries out my lids and leaves my lids chalky.  And my shadows crease anyway.  I was very disappointed with this product.  FYI my eyelids have always been a bit on the oily side."

         "description":"If your eyelids tend to get greasy, causing your eyeshadow to crease and fade, than this is the product for you. Eyeshadow has more distinctive color and lasts many hours, the lids do not get oily and therefore your eye make up stays put and smudge free. The secret is to use a tiny dot of it and it is enough to spread to almost all upper eyelid. That's it. I even use it on the outer edges of my lips, to prevent the lipstick from bleeding, and trust me - I sometimes work 12h shifts with mandatory red lipstick as part of the grooming and its the best thing ever - the red does not bleed (which I used to hate, before finding UDPP, as it looked messy) and it stays put for many hours without the need to replenish. Amazing. Plus, it saves you $$ as you do not have to buy lip primers. Love it."

It really does what it claimes to do: it increases the life of your shadow so it stays on until you take it off without any creases at all. It's really easy to apply; it just glides on and rubs in very smoothly and you're good to go. But the most amazing thing about ths product is the difference it makes in your eyeshadows' color and pigmentation, With this primer, the color is far richer and more highly pigmented than it would be without the primer so I really feel like I'm getting my money's worth out of my eyeshadows. One caveat though: you have to make sure you apply this product everywhere on your browbone and eyelid and apply it evenly or you'll end up with spots on your lid that are lighter that the colors of the rest of your eye. This product creates a creaseless, highly pigmented, professional finish that lasts all day long. I use it everyday and would recommend it to everybody. It's expensive, but it's definitely worth it!"

I have to squeeze a bunch out onto the back of my hand and mix together since it seems to have separated and then take the mixture and apply to my eyes for it to work. Otherwise if I just go straight from the tube it's an inconsistent oily mess that's impossible to blend on my lids and I end up with creases in a few hours.\n\nGO BACK TO THE WAND, at least I could stir it before using it and I wouldn't mind throwing away a bit at the end of use to save me the daily aggravation.

But when applied correctly, this is the best eyeshadow primer I have ever come across... Now if I could only find a foundation primer that I'm equally pleased with...."

Turns out, I don't know how I lived without it. After a full day of work, taking care of kids, getting hot in the car, etc., my eye makeup looks exactly the same as when I put it on at 6am. I guess the only disadvantage is that now makeup remover is a necessity because soap does not take it off. The tube lasts months, you only need to apply a little spot. Get the plain one, the colored one makes it much harder to apply."

There was no gloopy mess in the lid or around the opening; I could always make sure I got ALL of the product before it was empty; it was just easy. I wasn't too happy to see the applicator wand come back, but I bought another tube anyway because the product works, thinking I'd just get used to the packaging.\n\nThe minute I tried using it though, the wand left a big scratch on my eyelid. The soft fabric part of the wand doesn't completely cover the plastic tip. So now I can't use the wand even if I WANTED to because it physically hurts and scratches my skin.\n\nNow when I go to use the product, I take the wand out and squeeze it onto my finger anyway, which is nice I can still do that, but now I'm constantly having to clean out the lid and opening of the tube because of old, dry product that gets caked on there."

The product still works well to set eyeshadow and to keep it from creasing. But the applicator is not hygienic and will waste product in the long run. This makes me sad because the product does work; I can just seeing needing to replace it more often now versus when it was in a tube. One has to wonder if that was the reason why the company made the decision to move away from the squeeze tube. I will be seeking out another primer when I finish with this one. Fortunately there are lots of other good ones on the market now."

Finding this primer was a revelation---it kept my liquid liner (for reference, Kat Von D tattoo liner) in place through tears and in-climate weather and even swimming. I can say that these two products were some of the only makeup products I've encountered that NEVER let me down. Completely reliable.\n\nBut now! :( The Urban Decay primer is still okay---works well enough about 70% of the time. But when I'm at a party and someone has to tell me I have some creased eye makeup (after only wearing it for a few hours)... not acceptable.

Of course I still get a little bit of run off, but it is barely anything compared to what I had to deal with before I began to use this product. I would recommend this to everyone!"

You have to put it on really quickly and evenly or else it clumps strangely, especially at the inner corner of the eye. It's really easy to overdo it, so I put some of the cream on the back of my hand and use a concealer brush to put it on. Once I begin with the eyeshadow, I have to blend really quickly or else the colors will lock in place too early. I also found it to be really drying, so I use olive oil to remove all my makeup and then use Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil to dry to replenish moisture.

I walked to my friend's dorm which took 10 minutes, I walked to the cab, danced all night in a hot club, and then walked to/ waited for a bus for probably 20 minutes while it was still raining. I got back to the room expecting to see my face in ruin but my eye makeup was still in place with only a minimal amount of smudging at the bottom of my eye. It was INCREDIBLE! I was absolutely drenched from rain, but my smokey eye was perfectly in place without even a little creasing. I will never go to anything else!\n\nI highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality primer that ensures no smudging no matter what your day has in store for you."

But this is one product that everyone needs. I have tried multiple primers (Too Faced, Smashbox, NARS, LORAC) and this one outlasts them all. My eye shadow goes on with a more vibrant and true color than it does without a primer. But above that, it lasts all day and into the evening. My shadow doesn't end up with those lines in the crease of my eye at all; my shadow stays smooth and fresh looking all day.\n\nI haven't yet tried the new MUFE primer, but I'd be surprised if it is possible to be better than UD. And I do think the tube is preferable to a wand, from the standpoint of being easier to apply, and also getting every last bit of product out. But with that said, I'll probably try the MUFE at some point, for the sake of comparison :)"

         "description":"Fell in love with this perfect primer a couple years ago. I have dry skin and this, on top of my lotion, definitely doesn't have a drying effect and my shadow stays put all day. The formula is perfect. \r\nHowever, I can't give the current product 5 stars because I LOATHE the applicator wand. It's just too fussy and unnecessary. I miss the old squeeze tube so that I can get exactly how much I want and I like to blend it in with my fingers anyway. Plus I do not like the idea of touching the wand to my eyelids and then sticking it back into the tube. Yuck!"
