          "description":"I have been using this product for 2 whole weeks and I am loving it dearly. This eyeliner is so intense and really does stick onto your waterline! It almost refuses to come off with makeup remover haha Only downside is that it takes some warmth for the product to get onto your skin. I recommend breathing onto the tip to warm it up (weird, I know). Aside from that, this eyeliner is awesome sauce. I suggest if you want to blend this liner out that you do so within the first 10 seconds because this dries fast. I recommend this if you only want an intense and bulletproof waterliner though. I had a little trouble using this to draw my wing but thats okay, I got my Bobbi Brown gel liner to do the job! :)…read more"

          "description":"I've always been a liquid eyeliner girl since I mostly use eyeliner on my top lid. Most pencil eyeliners tend to catch on my skin and the line ends up looking chunky or broken.\n\nI have this liner in Brown(out) and am going to have to invest in a variety of colors. Besides the fact that this goes on SO smoothly, the shimmery colors are also light enough to use as a quick shadow. I use Brown(Out) on my top lid to enhance my eye color. I use a small amount on my bottom lid to create the \"dewy eye\" effect. Depending on the amount you put on, it is great smudged around and looks very sultry and not very harsh.\n\nFirst non-liquid eyeliner I've instantly loved.\nWould recommend this.\nLove it.…read more"

I am not putting it through any real tough tests either, this is just simple daily wear. Finally, I do think the \"on-site\" sharpener is very clever :-)…read more"

Wear is pretty good too. I'm glad I have it and I'm glad it was a \"freebie\" but I don't think I would repurchase because, to be totally honest, Sephora's own Contour Eye Pencils are every bit as good, in my opinion, at a fraction of the price of Marc's and perform just as well, though they do require sharpening while the Marc Jacobs pencils are twist up but that is the only advantage these have over those from Sephora and many other far less costly pencils.…read more"

On my way out I went to wipe it off my hand and it didn't budge. Like, at all. This led to me maniacally rubbing at it and still nothing. I was sold!\n\nI've only used this on my waterline, but it's nice and creamy to apply and definitely gave me a longer wear than the Urban Decay 24/7 liners. One other significant difference was that it wore off very evenly, so instead of the splotchy-ness I get from other liners as the day goes on, it simply faded from black to a soft grey.…read more"

Stays on all day, and can be difficult to remove even with remover, and doesn't get on contacts.\nWell, I used this for three straights days and it was mostly worn off w/in an hour.

Yes, it stays on forever, does not smear or flake off as does BB's gel liner when it begins to dry out. Much easier to include in your travel bag; no brush needed!

I line my eyes with it when I don't feel like putting eyeshadow on, and it looks very natural despite the purple color. It's creamy and glides on like a dream. I literally slide it once on my eye and I'm done.\nBlacquer is very very black, and it is just as creamy as Jazz. It dries differently though. I don't really know how to explain it... I have \"monolids,\" so I need a fairly thick line for it to look like I have anything on. The first time I used it, I let it dry completely before opening my eye in case it smudged. When I opened my eye, it kind of made a crease(?). It doesn't bother me but I just think it's interesting that it does that. If you don't know what a monolid is you can totally ignore that because it won't happen to you. One thing that I don't like about blacquer is that when I have my eyelashes curled and it gets on my lashes, it clumps them together and sometimes they stick to my lid as I apply the liner.\nBoth of these don't budge after they dry. Rain, sweat, and humidity don't affect these liners. I can rub my eyes without worrying about smudging. However, it comes off quite easily with remover wipes, so no furious scrubbing needed. If you need a sharp tip for thin lines, just use the sharpener to get it pointy again!\nAll the colors are beautiful, and they are worth the money. I especially recommend Jazz.…read more"

I also like the built-in sharpener. But after using for a few times I realize it's not very friendly to oily skin. It smudges after ~3 hours around the eyelids and outer corners of the eyes even if I carefully applied primer and setting power around the area. I also tried to blend it util it's a really thin layer and it helped reduce the smudging a little bit. So probably it's not enough to just draw the lines and let it set since it smudges easily if there is a lot of product. But I guess it's good if anyone is drawing beautiful smoky eyes :)…read more"

True pencils irritate my eyes (even if they're hypo-allergenic), so automatic liners are the only option for my water line.

I have extremely oily skin too and found the others worked better for me.\n\nI do love the other colours in this line up and I find the product easy to use as you just roll it up. The down fall is that I like a sharp tip when doing eyeliner for myself and clients. Marc Jacobs products come beautifully packaged but there are no instructions except for pictures. I feel like buying an Ikea product. The beauty associates at Sephora did not tell me about the sharpener that is built in. And for those of you are are stilll looking for it, it is on the cap or the product where you twist the product up.\n\nI also looked at the testers at the store.

However, these qualities present problems. This liner is not forgiving to beginners or those of us who don't have perfect technique. There is an extremely short window of time to erase mistakes, and there is usually a smudgy mess where you tried to erase. Once it's on, it's not coming off unless you want to scrub with eye makeup remover. It is also a very thick lead, making it almost impossible to get a thin line from it. I felt like I looked like Avril Lavigne - that's how thick this stuff goes on. Overall, I guess this is a good crayon for experts who like the Marc Jacobs line.

I have never had anything stay on my lower waterline (not even the revered UD Perversion which drifted within an hour), but I am now many hours into my day and it looks new and fresh.\r\n\r\nThere is one weird thing, and that is that it is blacker on the lower waterline than on the lashline--meaning that I guess it is not that opaque. Perversion is darker, but doesn't stay.  So, I just set the eyeliner over the lashline with carbon black eyeshadow and boom! \r\n\r\nBut the real coup here is that I've never been able to tightline before, and finally I can. This formula is so cream that it goes right on."

I also use it on my bottom but not on my waterline. There are only 2 problems I have with this liner 1. It doesn't stay on my waterline. To be fair I always have problems with eyeliner disappearing off my waterline BUT  I've used drugstore liners that worked better on my waterline. 2. After a few uses the tip is not sharp although the twist design of the pencil eliminates needing a sharpener & does make it convenient. That ones a catch 22."

          "description":"Since receiving these two eyeliners a few months ago, I have literally not worn any other liners...they are that good. I am not particularly adventurous with eyeliner shades, so I stayed in my comfort zone and ordered (Stone)Fox, which is a charcoal grey with gorgeous silver shimmer, and Brown(out), which is a deep, bronze-y brown with gold shimmer. I'd say they are basics, but there is really nothing basic about them. With almost effortless ease, these both glide across the lid like silk and leave behind a surprisingly complex line of shimmering color. The shimmer is just perfect - not too glittery or over-the-top, so it's a great option for both day and evening..You have a little bit of time to smudge the line out, if you so desire, but both of these set quickly and stay put. Though both shades work beautifully with eyeshadows, I most often wear them alone as they are so pretty that I hate to cover them up in any way. If you want a super-thin, precise line, be sure to use the included sharpener as the liner is very soft and does tend to create a thicker line after a few uses. I personally like a little thicker line, especially on my upper lid, as I want to show off these gorgeous shades and shimmer. Now that I've tried and fallen head over heels with these, I'm putting (Luna)tic at the top of my wishlist. I've heard a rumor that there is going to be a Holiday 2014 set of these highliners. If so, I know what Santa is going to be bringing me this year :)"

The MJ lasted 12 hours plus with the waterline pretty much intact.\nThe point does get dull quickly. I personally must use it with a brush if I want to line my upper lashline and do a winged line. I still prefer using Bobbi Brown gel liner or a liquid liner for top. But MJ is unbeatable in the waterline."

But, unfortunately, there's no creaminess to the formula and it sets incredibly quickly, so blending is almost impossible. Strangely, I found this particularly true with the black, the other colors I tried were not as bad, but not completely without this problem, either.\n\nWhat's more, after just a few weeks, my black pencil got very clumpy when applied, so I had little flecks of product that were just dried out and wouldn't budge on my lids.\n\nI returned the black pencil, thinking I just had a dud or somehow it had been exposed to air or something, but the second one I tried did the same thing.\n\nThere are so many great, creamy gel liners out there that blend well, don't tug or clump that I can't recommend this one."

If I want to use an eyeliner on a day or night that I won't be able to check myself in the mirror and touch up, this is my go-to eyeliner, over nars, and over urban decay.\n\nHowever! This has been strongly dependent on the color I use. I have Blacquer, Ro(cocoa), Stone(fox), Brown(out), and Luna(tic). I have found that Blacquer and Ro(cocoa) stay on the eyelids and lashline (it fades from the waterline, but has never resulted in raccoon eyes for me, and only minimal pooling in the corner of my eyes), whereas the more shimmery colors (brown(out), stone(fox), and luna(tic) ) are trickier to deal with. Once wearing luna(tic), I was able to rub the entire color off into rubbery pieces with my finger, which was disappointing. The shimmery colors also result in a bit of glitter fallout as the day goes on. Prepping the lid with either primer, or making sure whatever moisturizer you use is completely dried/absorbed, also allows the eyeliner to grab onto the lid better. I can speak from experience that josie maran argan oil moisturizers don't help; I was able to rub my eyeliner clean off when I'd applied the brand's spf moisturizer before putting on eyeliner."

          "description":"I bought this eyeliner after receiving a mini version of it last year for my birthday. I really loved how pigmented it was, easy to apply,  just a tiny bit will last the whole day and the packaging is just beautiful. The problem was that I finished my sample in more or less 2 months and my original size, which has much more product took a long time to end (which is great) but the problem is that after a certain time using it, the product gets dry and the pigment doesn`t come out anymore. It becomes chalky and ugly if you try to wear it. So I would only recommend it if you are sure you will use it fast enough, or if you have no problems throwing the rest of your eyeliner in the trash."

          "description":"I have oily Asian monolids where every time I squint or laugh, my eyes become invisible and whatever eyeliner I had on gets directly tattooed onto the bottom of my eyes. Thus, resulting in super panda look.\r\nIt has been a long journey on the path to finding a decent liner that requires minimal effort and powerful staying power. And it has come to a stop, for now! I bought this eyeliner in Brown(OUT) and it has been pretty phenomenal. This dark brown has just enough darkness, lightness, and tiny speckles to give me a versatile look. Black is too harsh and the Ro(Cocoa) is too light. It glides on really well and lasts all day* without major smudging. The only major downfall to this, hence the 4 stars, is the sharpener. A great idea, and when used correctly, produces a sharp point for precision. But I find the product will occasionally get stuck in the sharpener and make me lose a lot of product :( I have to keep a paper clip handy to clear out the sharpener. Otherwise, love, love this product.\r\n*I've applied many techniques to have minimal smudging throughout the day. Eye primer is a must. After applying the eyeliner, I'll add some dark brown eye shadow over it to \"fix\" it. Then, I also add some nude eye shadow to my lower lash line so the oiliness doesn't cause my eyeliner to smudge. On some days I have to wipe away some smudgyness with my finger during the day, but otherwise has been quite maintainable!"

I think Marc Jacobs should take a hint from Bobbi Brown's gel liner crayons, whose sharpeners don't seem to have this issue at all. If you're looking for a more basic color, like black, brown, or dark violet, I would definitely suggest Bobbi's over these."

          "description":"I have been using this eyeliner in black for the last 4 months and it was love at first use. First of all I want to mention that I have tried many brands from the drugstore (L'Oreal, Maybelline, Prestige) to more expensive (Clinique, Lancome, Stila , Urban Decay, Sephora)brands. I have tried pencil, liquid and gel forms of eyeliner. I have never found the right one because they always smeared, smudged, flaked or faded during the day. I had just about given up on finding the right one.\n\nI tried this one on an afterthought.....maybe just maybe the expense was worth it? When I originally purchased it in August of 2013 there were no reviews yet written so I took a chance and after using this product for over 4 months I can now truly say that FINALLY I have hit the jackpot. I use this product every day but now I find that I don't have to constantly check myself in the mirror for those hideous racoon eyes that I had become use to seeing. I have oily eyelids. My eyelid is also hooded which makes keeping the eyeliner on very difficult. I also have sensitive allergy prone eyes which is why I don't use primer. This eyeliner goes on smoothly without tugging and stays on without me applying any primer beforehand. With my allergies comes plenty of sneezing and watery eyes. No one will believe me that this eyeliner doesn't budge when I have one of my sneezing fits.\nYes this eyeliner is expensive but to me this is godsend and worth every penny. It has even lasted unlike my eyeshadow in extreme heat and humdity.\n\nThe quality of the pencil itself is pretty good. The only negative thing that I can say is that the sharpener itself is very wimpy, with a cheap thin plasticky feel to it. I personally don't use the sharpener as I like my eyeliner more on the thicker side. I basically just run the eyeliner tip against some tissue paper if I need to clean off the excess oil before use and the pencil works like new again. The sharpener end now seems to have loosened from the pencil itself and a couple of times I found it had fallen off into my makeup bag. After having used this eyeliner everyday for the last few months it still swirls up smoothly and swirls down closed into the pencil itself without getting stuck which has happened to me several times with other brands.\n\nIt also comes off very easily when I wash my face at night when I use my Clinique Comforting Cleanser.\n\nI never thought that I would write gushing glowing compliments on an eyeliner but this one really deserves it. I hope they never change this product because it has taken me ages to find something that I like. I am going to try the other colors and see if they perform as well as the black one. Truly..... I love this eyeliner!"

They last long and don't wear off as easily as other brands. I have tried liquid and gel liners, which have the staying power I want but never had the best luck applying them.\n\nThis product is amazing! It lasts for awhile (wore it for about 9hrs), even while outside in the sun. It was a little runny at the end of the day but hardly noticeable. Sometimes I look like I have a bruised eye with all the running some of my other liners have done.\n\nWhat's great is that it's a convenient crayon/pencil, but has the lasting power and intensity of a gel liner. It definitely isn't smudgable, unless you're some make-up pro who can figure it out over this amateur.\n\nThe price is a bit more of a splurge than I'm use to, so I might wait to try the other colors. But, I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!"

The formula is perfect for this technique! My liner looks only slightly worn by the time I wash my face at night, even on sweaty gym days! I've also worn this swimming in the ocean & as long as I don't rub my eyes, the liner doesn't budge. I have blaquer, (th)ink, brown out, and jazzberry. I love them all and I want mooooore. P.S.

It does glide and stay well, but the softness of the gel pencil is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, as it's pretty much never going to be at a nice point unless you're constantly sharpening.

When I tried it at home though, it immediately transferred from my lash line to my hooded eyelids. I tried keeping my eyes closed and allowing it to set more before opening them fully, but it always wandered quickly. The color was a rich, deep black and it may work for other eye shapes but it's not for me."

          "description":"This is by far the best eyeliner I've ever seen! I went into a Sephora store to pick up my birthday gift last month and I wanted to check out the Marc Jacobs products in person to make sure that was what I wanted. I went over to the display and did a little swatch of the eyeliner on my hand and I glided right on like butter! It was such a soft texture. But don't let that fool you! Soft DOES NOT mean it moves around. Of course when you go into Sephora you come out with tons of swatches on your hands. Of all the lip products I had swatched (most of which were supposed to be products with no transfer), the only thing on my hand that didn't budge was this eyeliner. I literally had to scrub at my hand with my finger to see even the slightest bit of transfer or movement. And it didn't even smudge around on my hand, only a little bit came off on my finger. When I finally got a chance to try it on my eyes, it went on really smooth and it felt great! I was able to accidentally smudge it when I was applying, but that's only because I get pretty oily in those areas. After it \"settled\", it stayed on all day long with absolutely no problems. This eyeliner survived my oily t-zone areas in addition to scorching and humid 100 degree Georgia heat (which of course led to a little more oil on my face). It's such a great product! I'd recommend it to anyone, and I'm definitely buying to full size when my sample runs out."

Since it is a crayon pencil, it is easier to control than applying gel with an eyeliner brush from a pot. The cons: I have to reapply one more time during the day to keep it fresh-looking. Also, I only gave it four stars, since I find the price to be pretty high, considering the quantity."

The packaging being so chic is a plus! I will definitely be reaching for this from now on! I was so in love with it I went back to Sephora today and swatched the rest of the colors.

I'm a die hard pencil fan & I do not like the super creamy eyeliners that are all the rage now - they seem to melt or fade quickly and are harder to work with. When I saw MJ's new line I had to try Blacquer in an effort to find a good black pencil. And a good black pencil it is! While it is creamy, it's not as creamy as some of the UD pencils (Perversion, which I absolutely cannot work with if I want a tightline). It glides on smoothly and the color is AMAZING. It's as black as Perversion but in my opinion it's prettier, it has a nice shine to it so those who like a matte finish might not like it. I love the feel of it in my hand as I'm applying it, it's luxurious yet functional. You will have some time to smudge but not much! Usually I line both eyes and then use my smudge brush but with this pencil you'll need to smudge right away. What I didn't like was while smudging, most of it came right off. It created a beautiful effect on the lower lash line but on top I had to darken it back in just a bit - no big deal at all considering. Once its set you're all done, this stuff will not move! I work 10 hour days and the staying power was incredible, I did a tiny little touch up halfway through my shift but nothing like what I usually have to do. The built in sharpener at the bottom of the pencil would be a genius idea if it worked. You have to twist the liner up to get it into the sharpener and once its in it basically does nothing. It shaved a tiny bit off the sides but did not give the sharp point I wanted. This is why I knocked off one star but all in all I am thrilled with this product and I highly recommend it. I will definitely re-purchase and am already planning on trying the raspberry and brown but I'm hoping MJ will come out with some more colors."

          "description":"I loved how smoothly this went on. At first. Then it progressively dried out and around 3 weeks later, I noticed it tugging and skipping a lot. I think the problem is that I live in an extremely dry climate and it got dried out once I opened it. Also, as with a number of automatic pencils, the tip just never got sharp enough to be as fine and precise as I prefer. On the plus side, it wore really well throughout the day and it didn't budge or smudge once it set, which is impressive considering that my eyelids are quite oily! This may be a good choice if you live in a humid climate."

I have already been through 2 of them in less than 2 months!!! the first one i used about 6 times a week on the top lash line and inside my water line each time. It lasted me less then a month!! I loved it so much i bought it again and decided to only use it for special occasions and weekends and use a lighter hand! this time it lasted me a little over a month!!! also the point gets dull very quick and the sharpener gets clogged and wastes a lot of the product when there is hardly any to begin with! As much as i love the product i dont know if i will buy it again, for $25 there should be more product!"

I bought this in Ro(cocoa) because I was looking for a mostly natural colour to wear every day. It's a little more red gold than Brown Out, which I will try when this runs out.\nIt glides on incredibly smoothly. The only thing I can compare the application to would be Tarte's SmolderEyes. Very soft, gel-like and just like butter!\nUnlike the Tarte though, this thing is bomb proof on me. Every liner and mascara I have ever used has smudged on me by the 4 o' clock, but this stays exactly where I put it. It does fade very slightly, but much less than other liners I've used. You can smudge it if you want right off the bat, and then it's on until you take it off. A bonus is that you don't need to remove either one with WP eye makeup remover; a micellar water works fine on both. I don't understand this magic, but it's my ideal scenario!\nThe only caution I'd give is if you're very particular about your colours. I've noticed that if I reapply this for evening, I have two distinct colours of liner for a minute or two until the second application oxidizes. On application, the colour is more gold, reddish brown, and it oxidizes to more of a plain brown, which works for my purposes.\n\nThe highest praise I can give right now is that this eyeliner is what I'm planning to use for my wedding makeup. The next liner I want to try is MJ's precision pen, for days I need to look more awake or would like a bit of a wing, because this doesn't give a very defined look."

The formula is great it is long wearing and it is very very black (I did a quick comparison in store to other high and low end brands few compared). The downsides are that it doesn't last very long--mine lasted for just 1 month. The short life can probably be associated with the second problem, the formula is way too soft for this package. I found myself constantly 'sharpening' and at no point was I ever able to get the pencil to in fact be a pencil point despite using the sharpening tool. It seems like this particular eyeliner needs to be repackaged and/or be put into a pot. It's not cheap and there are comparable options which is why I say wait it out...hopefully MJ will rework the product to make for a more consumer friendly experience."

          "description":"I held two VERY strong beliefs until I was 34:\r\n\r\n1) Designer brands are usually not ANY better than less expensive brands (some are arguably worse) and \r\n\r\n2) The even more firmly held belief (based on LOTS of experience) that eyeliners and mascaras were not worth paying more than drug store prices for. MOST shishi brands that I've tried are actually nowhere near as GOOD as drug store brands - they never glide on, they dry out easily, they usually don't last even half as long and I have to practically rip into my eyelid to get any pigment going (where as drug store brands - one slide over, and as long as you didn't goof up your line, you're good to go.)\r\n\r\nEnter Marc Jacobs.\r\n\r\nI originally purchased the mini trio of these (which if they're still selling - go. Go buy them now. I'll wait) just to try them out, forever on a quest to find a shishi eyeliner or mascara that was mind-blowingly different.\r\n\r\nI bought the minis maybe 6 months ago? I use them all at least once a week, I abuse them thoroughly, and they are MINI. Yet! I still have them, they still go on smooooothly and yay for PIGMENT. (Sidenote: the bronze looking one, I think it's called cocoa, always gets me compliments. I don't even have to do anything cool. I could put a dot in the middle of my eyelid, call it a day, and someone would comment on what a pretty color it is.)\r\n\r\nSo it is with a mix of happiness and sadness (before I tried these I was spending $8-$12 on eyeliner, after all) that I tell you these are the best. eyeliners. ever."

On the water line it will smudge out a little at the outer corners - you will still maintain some color on the waterline, however. So does it \"NEVER\" smudge? No. Does it stay remarkably well and not smudge terribly? Yes. \r\n\r\nIt goes on smoothly and very vividly - no dragging along the lid. You can crank up the pencil (no sharpener necessary). You can smudge it out when you first apply it for a smoky eye effect, if that's how you do yours. \r\n\r\nI'm a fan of this product and have finally found the pencil eyeliner that I'll repurchase."

It's very pigmented and dark. It also does not budge, which is something I look for and love in an eyeliner. It is more of a matte eyeliner and not shiny, which again, is a plus for me. It also works amazingly on the water line and for tightlining. However, the tip is rounded and not sharp. It does come with a built-in sharpener, but I don't find it very helpful. If you're looking for a thin, precise line I would not recommend this liner. For me, because of the rounded tip I get much more of a thick line and I don't always want that. It does go on very smoothly, but it can also be messy (if that makes sense). You can make or break your look quite easily. Upon applying I find that the liner does fake for me. It has gotten into my eyes, and as a contact wearer it is a big hassle. I want to love this liner, but I have a few reservations. I'm still on the fence about repurchasing.",

You can smudge it with shadow but unlike the other liners, it doesn't travel into the corners throughout the day and look messy. Instead of buying the full size version of this, I bought the MJ thin gel liner thinking it would be better for the waterline.

Honestly, this is what they really are. You can't sharpen these so you can't get a really fine line. When on lid, they look like eyeshadow instead of liner was placed there. My tip for lids, put them on your lash line then take an eyeliner like trooper or whatever and draw under the MJ.\nHonestly, if these were marketed what they are, eyeshadow pencils , I wouldn't be as disappointed as I am. I just find, at this price point, there are much better pencils for less, like the MUFE liners.\nPros= beautiful colors. Great quality eyeshadow pencils that won't run in your eye.\nNegative= the price and how these are marketed as eyeliners when they are really shadows.

Although it's a \"gel\", it's easy to smudge on the hand when played with in store. However, smudging on the eyelid becomes a real challenge, and I can never achieve the right smokey smudge that other eyeliners are able to give. Trying to sharpen the crayon can be difficult and wasteful of the expensive crayon. to get a decent crayon tip, I have to form it myself with a tissue. If you're looking for fantastic colors, Marc Jacobs has them. But if you're wanting a good smudge, you should probably look elsewhere."

That's my beef with this product.\r\nI also went ahead and tried the Lancome Liqui-liners which are very similar, and Lumiere and Lume are wayyyy to bright. They look extremely unnatural under the eyes whereas the Marc Jacobs one is ery subdued. But I'd take natural over over-the-top any day. The Lancome ones also bother my eyes a bit, whereas the Marc Jacobs one doesn't bother me at all. \r\nI think the shimmery eyeliners are fine for under the eyes.

At first I tried to use it as a regular eyeliner & was super annoyed as I couldn't get it to be very sharp, even at the first try. And because it's a turn-out eyeliner you can't sharpen it so it's not like it will ever be sharp again. So I will keep using my Kat Von D tattoo liner as my primary liner. But this works great as a waterline liner. It doesn't smudge for hours on end. I wore it all day & it stayed! Where other waterline liners will run on me after 4-5 hours, this was fine for over 12 hrs. I even went to sleep with it on and in the morning it disappeared but I didn't look like a racoon at least.\r\n\r\nSo you know, not great as a regular liner (though it did last on my very oily lids, so who knows, maybe if you like thick eyeliner & don't care about smudgey looks...) But awesome as a waterline liner. 10/10 :)"

It does set very quickly and will stay that way until you take it off, so if you do want to achieve a smudged look, it needs to be smudged immediately after application.

I live in Orlando where the weather is hot and humid and this didn't budge.  I have the dark brown color and the paris blue color which I love. The only downsides for me is that the point does not remain sharp so I have to work around that a bit and the price is a little high but the trade off is that it works and stays put and colors are beautiful!

You go to the shop and look at the display, and the single pencils are in long tubes. The value sets are in little shorter tubes. But when I look online at the amount of product, 0.01 oz, I realize it's the same amount of product as I get in the three minis set. And I just checked the old tubes I had from the Christmas set, and they are also 0.01 oz. So the packaging size changes, but the amount of product is the same in the small tubes as in the big tubes.

I put up with it since I only use it sometimes, but I don't recommend this for every day use to someone who has sensitive skin or eyes."

          "description":"I was SUPER impressed when I swatched these in store on my hand, they didn't budge and were so pigmented. In need of a great liner for my waterline, I justified the $25 price tag in my mind and splurged on both the Black and Jazzberry. I was even more impressed when I went home and took a bath and a shower and the swatches were still on my hand! Heavy duty makeup remover finally did the trick. Let me just say the Jazzberry is very unique and an amazing metallic cranberry color perfect for fall/winter. The issue I have is that, like every other liner I've ever worn on the waterline, there is some wear throughout the day. Its not a big deal, I've never found anything that stays on truly as well as when it is first applied throughout the day. The trouble is you can't reapply this liner on top of itself...like AT ALL!!! I tried to make the liner a little bolder and touch up the spots that were wearing and it was a disaster! Once it is dry, if you try to go back over it, layering the product, you end up with these tiny little chunks of dried liner flaking off in your eye. Its really annoying and they were hard to get out of my eye. I felt like I had little pebbles in them until I completely washed it off. At least with Kohl liners, you can layer them on top if needed to intensify...no such luck with these gel liners. I'm going to keep them for use on the upper and lower lid...but they will not be used on the water line again!"

Somehow. The black is SO intensely pigmented. Soft, non-dragging, not dry nor crumbly at all. I've left it in hot car for days & I have never had an issue with it melting or changing in forumula even after over a year of use. Very, very good eyeliner. Worth the price. Just like what it says a pot eyeliner in a pencil form. I only use it for my waterlines and the only downside is I cannot sharpen it to line the top of my eyes. Also a great base for a smokey eye that will last thru.... Anything! POSSIBLE DUPE ALERT: The only other pencil it compares it to is the 'Tarte Skinny SmolderEyes' (in Onyx) the amazonian clay is similar to gel liner."

The problem for me with most eyeliners is that they all smudge underneath my eyes. I tried every one in the drugstore, I tried the \"glorified\" one by Jane Cosmetics, I tried other highend brands and they just all failed. Maybe it's just my eyes?\nSo I was sckeptical about this $25 eyeliner and thought that if this fails me as well, I'll just return it back to Sephora. And of my gosh, it is amazing. First of all, it is very very pigmented and it feels like a thicker gel eyeliner that usually comes in a jar (think Bobbie Brown), but it's in a pencil form and is much more comfortable to apply and blend. Once this sets it DOES NOT MOVE. Anywhere! Even in the waterline it stays put for hours and hours.

          "description":"I fell in love with the n(ice) silver color in the Sephora store. I purchased it originally to take on Bonaroo 2014 with an attention-grabbing look and also for youtube videos. The store had sold out completely of the Luna(tic), so that is a color to check out for sure because it was significantly more popular or less well stocked. The employees confirmed that the color had been swooped up the fastest.\n\nI ordered the Blacquer and by far it is the smoothest black that glides on opaque in one stroke. If you're not getting that one stroke thing, try warming it in your hands for a while. It is really hard to remove this gel liner, but that's the point. I was disappointed that there wasn't a white color.\n\nThe mari(gold) is a deeper gold with luster. If you have an olive or darker skin-tone, it can easily create a convincing Egyptian look from Old Hollywood.\n\nAll the colors seem to have different properties--which makes sense since different pigments come from different places. The black is the one I would recommend for men and women alike. Guyliner dudes, this one is a must have. I know they are twenty-five dollars each but it is an investment that people will compliment you on all day! All my friends whom see it on me ask what the black is especially.\n\nDon't play with the mechanical twirl of it because it may not go back down, and it is expensive--so don't ruin it."

It goes on smoothly.\n\nHowever, I find it very hard to remove; after 3 or 4 days of wearing it I started getting buildup around the base of my eyelashes. In addition, the crayon is thick; maybe it's just me but I have never figured out how to successfully use that little \"sharpener\" on the end of the retractable eyeliners.\n\nI wish this really was like a gel pot eyeliner, but it not as precise as a gel pot, it builds up more than a gel pot, and it doesn't stay put as long as a gel pot.\n\nIf you want gel eyeliner, I would suggest going with a gel pot."

It really is a pretty color. But if I could go back in time I'd take the $50 I spent on these liners and use them on a MJ shadow palette.\n\nAnyway, the texture is fairly soft. You can smudge these. The black feels more workable for smokey/smudgey than the champagne color to me. I like the feature that you twist them up instead of sharpening as they wear down. Very nice liners, just not what I was looking for. If you're in the market for a tightlining eyeliner I'd think twice before buying from this line. Otherwise, these are quite nice!"

For years, I have searched for a very pigmented black liner for my water line and inner corners, where I have the most trouble keeping my eyeliner on. I think I may have found the best eyeliner for me.\n\nI got this item as a 100 point perk to try out the new Marc Jacobs line and was immediately pleased with the pitch black consistency when I swatched the liner on my hand. In the shower, an hour or so later, I had to give the swatch a good scrub to remove, which got me really excited to give this liner a real go the next morning.\n\nI have used this several times since and overall, I am very pleased. As watery as my eyes are, this liner stays on longer than any I have tried before it on my lower lash line and I use this in my inner \"v\" to re-enforce my top liner. This liner will not create raccoon eye and a little will go a long, long way due to it's wonderfully smooth and impossibly dark color.\n\nBottom line, I very much plan on purchasing this item when I run out and highly recommend those with watery eyes to give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."

          "description":"I truly think this is one of the best liners I have ever used. I have never used a gel liner before, but since this was in pencil or \"crayon\" form, I decided it was best for travel. I purchased the shades Blacquer, Ro(Cocoa), and Brown(Out). The Brown(Out) and Blacquer shades glided on so smoothly with ease and lasted forever. I have monolids and these liners did not budge. I don't doubt the staying power, however, I have seemed to have gotten an old liner in the Ro(Cocoa) shade. It did not go on as smoothly and even tugged my eyelid during application, resulting in an uneven and splotchy line. I'm not sure if it was because it was an old liner or if it was because it had a different formula than the others. Also for those of you who are in between Ro(Cocoa) or Brown(Out), I recommend Brown(Out). It is more neutral, while Ro(Cocoa) is a warmer shade with copper undertones. Brown(Out) does have shimmer in it with a brassy undertone, but I find it more flattering overall."

Each gal had several favorite products, but all agreed: the Highliner, Lash Lifter mascara and lip products were seriously to die for. They all said they were unlike any other products - from color saturation and wear to high quality packaging with unique features. I decided to try the Highliner, as I'm always looking for a violet liner to bring out the green in my hazel eyes. Jazz (berry) did just that. It went on smooth and silky. It was super easy to control the amount of liner applied and the thickness of the line plus I had plenty of time to smudge/blend the line before it dried. These qualities are very important to me, as I'm usually just awful at applying liner - pencil, gel or liquid, under my incapable hands often leave me looking clownish. I'm blown away by how easily this liner was to apply. Plus, it lasted all day (and all night, as I forgot to remove it at bedtime!)."

The tip isn't very sharp too, so it's harder to control, and it is very hard to me to make sharp thin lines. If you mess up, you better clean it up RIGHT AWAY, if not you would have to take it off with a make up remover. Overall, I love the product, even though I have to spend more time putting it on.

However, the formula was not at all like what I tried in store. It was hard to use (dragged on my eyelid) and barely blended (tried blending 2 seconds after application). The top doesn't stay pointed for long and the sharpener is a nightmare to use (top broke off more than once in it!). I am not sure if this formula is sensitive to room temperature, but it was warm in the store and under bright lights but cooler in my home (late September in Canada) which may explain the difference in formulas between the tester and the one I bought.

I woke up at 9am, used this eyeliner, and then went and sat in the 31 degrees sun until 2pm, and that's when I went swimming. Full on, head under the wader swimming. After I got out it looked flawless so I went and spent the night at the club. Flashforward a very long night I ended up falling asleep and forgot to take my makeup off. I went and took a shower. When I came out, MY EYELINER STILL LOOKED GOOD! And by good i mean I could go out in public with it on. I've been using it since Jan, every single day, its April and I'm not even half way through the tube. Buy this. Now."

          "description":"I never used to wear eyeliner because I couldn't apply it thin enough above my lash line. Then I saw a video on tightlining and I've been hooked ever since. I've bought a lot of different eyeliners looking for one that lasted and in the right color of blue. I found it with this eyeliner in the color Midnight in Paris. I have swatched so many eyeliners on the back of my hands!..lol Recently I was in Sephora and I swatched several different colors of this liner. One of the girls at Sephora saw me trying to wipe off my hand with make up remover and came over to help. She ended up having to use a spoolie brush to scrub off the swatches! Besides the color and staying power, I just love how easy this liner is to use. They're not too hard and they're not too soft. They just glide on easily with great color payoff. I've been debating the hot pink color. :-)"
